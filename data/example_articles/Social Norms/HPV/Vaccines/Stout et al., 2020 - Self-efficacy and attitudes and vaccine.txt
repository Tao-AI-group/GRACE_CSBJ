Despite  college students’ high risk for HPV, their vaccination rates remain suboptimal. The current observational study examined  the relationship between social norms and HPV vaccine intentions and potential mechanisms underlying this relationship  among undergraduates. Participants (N = 190; 66.8% female) completed a survey assessing HPV vaccine social norms, atti- tudes, self-efficacy, and intentions. Three mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether self-efficacy and attitudes  mediated the relationship between social norms (i.e., parents, friends, doctor) and intentions, controlling for demographic  and health care covariates. Social norms were indirectly related to intentions through self-efficacy and attitudes in multiple  models (ps < .05). Specifically, perceiving greater support for HPV vaccination from one’s friends, parents, and doctor was  related to greater HPV vaccine self-efficacy, which, in turn, was related to increased vaccine intentions. In addition, perceiving  greater parental and doctor support for HPV vaccination was related to more favorable attitudes towards the vaccine, which,  in turn, were related to increased vaccine intentions. Findings suggest potential targets for future interventions to promote  HPV vaccination among young adults. Keywords  Human papillomavirus vaccination · Social norms · Self-efficacy · Attitudes · Theory of planned behavior Introduction Most sexually active individuals in the United States will  be infected with at least one human papillomavirus (HPV)  strain during their lifetime [1]. The majority of HPV infec- tions resolve without treatment; however, persistent infec- tions from high-risk HPV types can develop into oropharyn- geal, cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancers  [1–3]. The HPV vaccine is most effective prior to any sexual  experience, and thus, the target age range for vaccination is  in early adolescence [1–4]. The vaccine series can be admin- istered to males and females starting at age 9 [2–4] and is  approved for use through age 45 [2]. Young adults in the United States are at significantly  higher risk for HPV infection compared to other age groups  [5]. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  (ACIP) recommends all previously unvaccinated males and  females receive “catch-up vaccination” through age 26 [4].  Although the vaccine is approved through age 45, the ACIP  recommends that individuals ages 27–45 years old engage  in shared clinical  decision-making about HPV vaccination  Madison E.

Although college-aged individuals  are at high risk for being exposed to HPV [5], only 40–69%  of female college students and 8–43% of male college stu- dents report initiating the HPV vaccine series [6–8] The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) provides a frame- work for studies of HPV vaccine intentions and uptake in  college students and young adults [9, 10]. TPB is used  to explain engagement in a specific behavior by examin- ing beliefs, such as attitudes, self-efficacy, intentions, and  subjective social norms about the behavior [11]. Consist- ent with this theory, greater social norms (i.e., perceptions  that important others support HPV vaccination) have been  associated with greater vaccine intentions and uptake among  college students and young adults [9, 10, 12–15]. However,  many studies have focused on global social norms rather  than examining relations between specific social norms  (e.g., parents, peers, doctor) and young adults’ HPV vaccine  intentions and behaviors. Studies also have yet to identify  mechanisms through which social norms may influence HPV  vaccine intentions. TPB suggests that perceived behavioral control, a con- struct comparable to self-efficacy or the belief in one’s  ability to accomplish a task, may be associated with both  social norms and intentions to receive the HPV vaccine [10].  Consistent with this theory, self-efficacy is related to social  norms for other health behaviors in college students, such as  obtaining adequate sleep and condom use [16, 17]. Addition- ally, greater self-efficacy for HPV vaccination has been asso- ciated with increased vaccine acceptability and intentions  in college students [18–20] and young adults [21]. Findings  from qualitative research suggest that self-efficacy may be  one mechanism through which social norms influence col- lege students’ intentions to be vaccinated [22, 23]. For exam- ple, among college women, support from their mother and  healthcare provider to receive the HPV vaccine appeared  to foster their belief that they could complete the necessary  steps to be vaccinated in the future [22]. In another qualita- tive study, college women reported that family members’  assistance in overcoming barriers to HPV vaccination (e.g.,  paying for the vaccine, scheduling the vaccine appointment)  bolstered their confidence in their ability to be vaccinated  [23]. Friends were only viewed as important in HPV vaccine  decision-making when they related their personal experi- ences with vaccination, thereby increasing perceptions of  vaccine safety and intentions to be vaccinated [22]. Attitudes about HPV vaccination is another TPB con- struct that may help explain the relationship between social  norms and vaccine intentions [10]. These attitudes include  positive or negative opinions of the HPV vaccine (e.g.,  getting the HPV vaccine would be foolish) as well as the  belief that HPV vaccination leads to positive or negative  outcomes (e.g., getting the HPV vaccine will prevent can- cer) [11]. Theory suggests that young adults’ perception that  important others support their receipt of the HPV vaccine  might increase their positive attitudes towards obtaining it  and, in turn, their vaccine intentions. Believing that impor- tant others see value in obtaining the HPV vaccination may  influence how one views the vaccine [22, 23], whereas nega- tive attitudes from important others toward the vaccine may  contribute to inaction [24]. For example, a qualitative study  of female college students revealed how support for the HPV  vaccine from important others might influence their attitudes  about the vaccine through social motivation (e.g., trust in  their provider, friends modeling vaccination behaviors) [22].  Another qualitative study of college women suggested that  descriptive peer norms (i.e., having friends who have been  vaccinated) may serve to reduce stigma about the HPV vac- cine [23]. Conversely, negative attitudes toward the vaccine  from important others may lead to the decision to not ini- tiate the vaccine series [24]. Indeed, among unvaccinated  young adults, attitudes about the HPV vaccine and perceived  social norms regarding vaccination are significantly associ- ated with vaccine intentions [11]. Additionally, a number of  studies with college students and young adults have found  a relationship between attitudes about the HPV vaccine and  intentions to receive the vaccine [7, 9–11, 13, 25, 26]. The present study expands prior research on the relation- ship between social norms and HPV vaccine intentions by  considering specific social norms (parent, friend, and doctor)  separately and examining potential mechanisms that might  underlie their relationships to vaccine intentions. This study  focused on college students given their high risk for HPV,  ability to make HPV vaccination decisions for themselves,  and suboptimal vaccination rates [5]. In the current study,  we focused on college students in Indiana, one of the lowest- ranking states for HPV vaccination rates among young adults  [27]. Based on the TPB [10], we hypothesized that greater  perceived parental, friend, and doctor norms for HPV vacci- nation would be related to increased intentions to receive the  HPV vaccine. Further, we hypothesized that increased self- efficacy for HPV vaccination and positive attitudes about the  HPV vaccine would mediate the relationships between each  of the three social norms and vaccine intentions. Study find- ings have direct implications for intervention development  to promote HPV vaccination in this population. Material and Methods Participants and Procedures Undergraduates were recruited through a psychology par- ticipant pool at an urban, public university in Indiana to par- ticipate in a cross-sectional, observational study. Participants  (N = 434) were between 18 and 35 years of age and fluent  in English. Following verbal informed consent procedures, 

1189 Journal of Community Health (2020) 45:1187–1195	 1 3 participants completed an anonymous online survey (mean  completion time: 39.27 min (SD = 9.4 min) administered  in a campus computer lab in groups ranging from 1 to 15  people. Participants were seated with space between them  to facilitate privacy when responding to the survey. Data  were collected between January and December 2015. Due  to anonymous data collection, the Indiana University-Purdue  University Indianapolis IRB identified the study as exempt. Measures HPV Vaccination Status Participants were given a written description of the HPV  vaccine and then were asked one yes/no question to indicate  if they had heard of the vaccine prior to study participa- tion [28]. Those who had heard of the vaccine were asked  whether they had ever received it [28]. Individuals who had  not heard of the vaccine and those who reported that they  had not received the vaccine were considered unvaccinated.  Only unvaccinated individuals were included in the current  analyses. HPV Vaccination Intentions Intentions to receive the HPV vaccine were measured with  five items [10]. Participants rated on a 7-point scale how  likely they were to: (1) get more information about the HPV  vaccine, (2) consider getting the vaccine, (3) try to get the  vaccine, (4) actually get the vaccine, and (5) get the vaccine  if a doctor offered it (1 = very unlikely to 7 = very likely).  This subscale showed excellent reliability in the current  sample (α = 0.95). Subjective Social Norms Subjective social norms for HPV vaccination were measured  with three items [11]. Participants were asked to indicate  their degree of agreement with three separate statements  that their friends, parents, and doctor support their receipt  of the vaccine on a 7-point scale (1 = very strongly disagree  to 7 = very strongly agree). Self‑efficacy Self-efficacy was measured with three items [10]. On a  7-point scale (1 = disagree strongly to 7 = agree strongly),  participants rated their confidence in their ability to get the  HPV vaccine even if: (1) it is expensive, (2) getting the shot  hurts a little, and (3) it means finding time to go to the doctor  three times. The scale had excellent reliability in the current  study (α = 0.80). Attitudes Toward The HPV Vaccine Attitudes toward the HPV vaccine were measured with five  items [11]. Participants were asked to indicate how: (1)  good or bad, (2) wise or foolish, (3) pleasant or unpleasant,  (4) effective or ineffective, and (5) painless or painful they  believed receiving the HPV vaccine would be on a 7-point  scale. The scale had acceptable reliability in the current sam- ple (α = 0.73). Demographic, Healthcare, and Sexual Experience Variables Participants reported demographic information, including  gender, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and current  relationship status. Participants also responded to the fol- lowing healthcare variables: (1) their health insurance status  [29]; (2) how many times they had seen a healthcare pro- vider in the past 12 months (dichotomized as having seen  a provider in the last year [yes/no]) [29]; and (3) whether a  provider had ever recommended that they obtain the HPV  vaccine [29]. In addition, participants reported whether they  had prior sexual experience and the number of sexual part- ners in the past three months (dichotomized as having been  sexually active in the past three months [yes/no]) [30]. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS statisti- cal software (SPSS Inc., version 24, Armonk, NY, 2016).  Given our focus on vaccine intentions, participants who had  received the vaccine were excluded from analyses (15 men  and 207 women out of 434 total). Additionally, because the  vaccine was not approved for individuals over 26 years of  age at the time the data were collected [31], participants over  the age of 26 (n = 8) were excluded. Further, 14 participants  were excluded from analyses due to missing data on key  variables (e.g., vaccine status, age). Thus, data from 190  participants were analyzed in the present study. First, descriptive statistics were examined and Pear- son correlations were calculated between study variables.  Next, multiple mediation analyses were conducted to test  the hypothesis that self-efficacy and attitudes mediate the  relationships between social norms (parent, doctor, and  friend) and intentions to receive the HPV vaccine. A multi- ple mediation model tests both the overall mediation effect  for the mediators in the model (total indirect effect) and  the independent effects of the mediators (specific indirect  effects) [32, 33]. Each type of social norm was examined  in a separate multiple mediation analysis. Participant gen- der, visiting a healthcare provider in the past 12 months,  physician recommendation, and health insurance status  were control variables in all analyses, given their prior  associations with HPV vaccine intentions [7, 34–36]. 

1190 	 Journal of Community Health (2020) 45:1187–1195 1 3 Mediation analyses were conducted using Preacher and  Hayes’ bootstrapping procedures (5000 resamples) in  SPSS (version 24; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) macros. Due  to repeating analyses, an adjusted confidence interval of  99% was used. All analyses were two-tailed. Results Participant Characteristics Participant demographics are presented in Table 1. The  majority of participants (N = 190) were female (66.8%),  White (68.9%), heterosexual (92.1%), and had health  insurance (89.5%). The average participant age was  19.4 years (SD = 1.6). Most (76.8%) had previously heard  of the HPV vaccine, and 48.6% of those who had heard of  the vaccine reported that their doctor or another health- care professional had recommended that they receive it.  Additionally, the majority (82.6%) had visited a healthcare  provider in the past 12 months. Two-thirds of participants  (66.8%) had had at least one sexual experience, and 55.2%  had been sexually active in the prior three months. Bivariate Associations Between Social Norms,  Self‑efficacy, and HPV Vaccine Intentions Correlations between main study variables are presented in  Table 2. Each of the social norms for HPV vaccination were  positively correlated with self-efficacy (ps < 0.001) and vac- cine intentions (ps < 0.001). In other words, stronger percep- tions that their parents, friends, or doctor supported receipt  of the HPV vaccine were associated with increased self- efficacy and intentions to receive the vaccine. Additionally,  more favorable attitudes towards the HPV vaccine was cor- related with perceiving stronger social norms for HPV vac- cination from parents and doctors (ps < 0.001). Additional  correlations between study variables including gender and  healthcare experiences are displayed in Table 2. Mediation The potential mediating roles of self-efficacy and attitudes  about the HPV vaccine in the associations between social  norms and intentions to receive the vaccine were examined  using three bias-corrected bootstrapped multiple mediation  analyses. All models included gender, health insurance sta- tus, physician recommendation, and visit with a healthcare  provider in the past year as covariates.

1191 Journal of Community Health (2020) 45:1187–1195	 1 3 Friend Norms Results indicated that friend norms, self-efficacy, HPV  vaccine attitudes, and covariates accounted for 46% of the  variation in HPV vaccine intentions. Friend norms had a  significant indirect effect on intentions through self-efficacy  (indirect effect 0.10; 99% CI 0.03–0.21; see Fig. 1a). Perceiv- ing stronger friend norms for vaccination was associated  with greater self-efficacy for vaccination which, in turn,  was associated with greater intentions to receive the vac- cine. However, positive attitudes towards the vaccine did  not mediate the relationship between friend norms and vac- cine intentions (indirect effect 0.05; 99% CI − 0.03–0.15; see  Fig. 1a). Parent Norms Results indicated that parent norms, self-efficacy, HPV  vaccine attitudes, and covariates accounted for 42% of the  variation in HPV vaccine intentions. Parent norms had  a significant indirect effect on HPV vaccine intentions  through self-efficacy (indirect effect 0.14; 99% CI 0.06–0.25)  and HPV vaccine attitudes (indirect effect 0.10; 99%  CI 0.01–0.20; see Fig. 1b). Perceiving stronger parent norms  for vaccination was associated with greater self-efficacy  and more favorable attitudes towards the vaccine, which,  in turn, were associated with greater intentions to receive  the vaccine. Doctor Norms Results indicated that doctor norms, self-efficacy, HPV  vaccine attitudes, and covariates accounted for 38% of the  variation in HPV vaccine intentions. Doctor norms had a  significant indirect effect on HPV vaccine intentions through  self-efficacy (indirect effect 0.11; 99% CI 0.02–0.24; see  Fig. 1c) and HPV vaccine attitudes (indirect effect 0.12; 99%  CI 0.03–0.25; see Fig. 1c). Perceiving stronger doctor norms  was associated with greater self-efficacy and more favorable  attitudes towards the vaccine, which, in turn, were associated  with greater intentions to receive the vaccine. Discussion The current study is the first to quantitatively examine mech- anisms by which specific social norms (friend, parent, and  doctor) may affect college students’ intentions to receive the  HPV vaccine. Our results suggest that perceiving greater  support from one’s friends, parents, and doctor for HPV  vaccination is related to greater self-efficacy for vaccina- tion which, in turn, is related to increased vaccine intentions.

1192 	 Journal of Community Health (2020) 45:1187–1195 1 3 Additionally, findings suggest that perceiving greater sup- port for HPV vaccination from parents and doctors—but  not friends—is related to more favorable attitudes towards  the vaccine, which, in turn, are related to increased vaccine  intentions. Findings are grounded in the TPB and converge  with prior research suggesting that social norms for other  health behaviors (e.g., sleep, condom use) are related to col- lege students’ intentions and behaviors through self-efficacy  [16, 17]. Results are also consistent with qualitative findings  that perceived social support for HPV vaccination bolsters  self-efficacy for vaccine completion in college women [22]. Additionally, our findings suggest that doctor and parental  support for HPV vaccination may relate more strongly to  HPV vaccine attitudes than friend support for vaccination.  This pattern is consistent with qualitative research suggest- ing that friends are less influential in the HPV vaccine deci- sion-making process among young adults [22, 24]. Young  adults have reported varying degrees of trust in their friends’  opinion of the HPV vaccine, especially if they have not been  vaccinated themselves [22, 24]. Our findings inform future intervention research to  increase HPV vaccination rates among college students.

1193 Journal of Community Health (2020) 45:1187–1195	 1 3 particular, if replicated longitudinally, results suggest that  increasing perceived support for the HPV vaccine from mul- tiple sources (e.g., parents, peers, healthcare providers) may  lead to students’ increased intentions to receive the HPV  vaccine. To date, limited intervention research designed to  increase HPV vaccine intentions or uptake has been con- ducted with U.S. college students and/or young adults [18,  37–41]. Only one intervention trial examined the impor- tance of the source of the information (e.g., peer, provider)  in providing HPV vaccine education to college students [37].  Specifically, this randomized control trial for college women  featured narratives delivered by either a peer, an expert (i.e.,  a physician), or both and incorporated theory-driven cog- nitive factors such as perceived susceptibility to HPV and  self-efficacy for vaccination [37]. The group that received  messages from both a peer and a physician were twice as  likely to obtain the vaccine than control groups that either  received an informational video, a link to a campus website  about HPV vaccination, or no message. Converging with the  current findings, effects of the intervention were mediated  by self-efficacy such that those who received the combined  peer and expert message reported higher vaccine self-effi- cacy, which, in turn, predicted greater intentions to obtain  the vaccine [37]. An important next step will be to compare  the combined and separate effects of messages about the  HPV vaccine from a parent, peer, or physician, especially  for ethnocultural groups with strong norms for following  parental guidance. Prior studies have suggested that provider recommenda- tion is the strongest predictor of HPV vaccine receipt among  young adults [42, 43]. More than one-third (37%) of the  present sample, all of whom were unvaccinated, reported  receiving an HPV vaccine recommendation from a health- care provider. Of note, however, only a moderate correlation  (r = 0.47) was found between perceived doctor norms for  vaccination and physician recommendation. This finding  may reflect variation in the quality or strength of provider  recommendations, highlighting the need for provider educa- tion on effective methods for delivering recommendations.  In addition, although multi-level intervention trials that  facilitate a strong provider recommendation have improved  HPV vaccination among adolescents [44, 45], a paucity of  interventions have targeted providers and clinics providing  care to college students. The only systems-level interven- tion for this population incorporated electronic health record  alerts in the charts of unvaccinated male patients at a uni- versity student health center, which resulted in HPV vaccine  initiation rates rising from 5 to 25% among male patients  [39]. Research identifying effective elements of provider  communication about the HPV vaccine with young adults  is needed as are interventions that test the efficacy of multi- level and multi-component strategies to promote HPV vac- cination in this population. The current findings suggest that positive communication  about the HPV vaccine from providers and important oth- ers may promote vaccine intentions by improving attitudes  and increasing self-efficacy. To target these variables, future  interventions may include strong recommendations and  approval for the vaccine from multiple sources, specifically  highlighting HPV vaccine benefits, safety, and efficacy as  well as young adults’ risk of HPV infection. Prior research  has demonstrated that self-efficacy also mediates the rela- tionships between both perceived barriers and perceived risk  and HPV vaccination among female college students [20].  Thus, educational messages that directly address common  HPV vaccine barriers (e.g., cost, fear of shots, multiple trips  to clinic for completion doses, cultural or religious consid- erations) [24, 35, 46] may also improve self-efficacy. Limitations of the current study should be noted. The  study was cross-sectional, and thus mediating relation- ships warrant replication in longitudinal studies. In addi- tion, the majority of the sample was White and female, and  all attended an urban public university in Indiana. Further  research is needed to determine the generalizability of study  findings to college students with different demographics and  those in other regions of the United States. Another limita- tion is that we did not obtain medical record confirmation  of participants’ HPV vaccine status; however, prior research  has supported the validity of self-reported HPV vaccination  (i.e., over 90% sensitivity) [47]. We also did not measure  subsequent vaccine uptake among those who were unvacci- nated. However, prior studies have found that HPV vaccine  intentions are significantly associated with subsequent HPV  vaccine uptake among college students [48]. Finally, we did  not assess whether participants had discussed the HPV vac- cine with their parents or peers. Conclusions Given college students’ high risk for HPV infection [5] and  suboptimal vaccination rates [6–8], effective interventions  are needed to promote HPV vaccination in this population.  Previous interventions to increase HPV vaccination have  largely focused on young children and adolescents and their  parents [44, 49]. If replicated longitudinally, our results sup- port testing HPV vaccine interventions for college students  that aim to improve self-efficacy for vaccination and atti- tudes about the HPV vaccine by facilitating positive com- munication about the vaccine with providers and important  others.
