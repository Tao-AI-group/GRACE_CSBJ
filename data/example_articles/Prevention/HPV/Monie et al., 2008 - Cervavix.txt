Persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is a nec- essary cause of cervical cancer. Thus, prophylactic vaccination against HPV is an attractive  strategy to prevent cervical cancer. Current strategies for the development of safe and effective  preventive vaccines are based on the induction of neutralizing antibodies against the major capsid  protein, L1 of HPV. Cervarix™ is one of the preventive HPV vaccines that has been approved in  the Europe and Australia and is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administra- tion. Cervarix is composed of HPV16 and HPV18 L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) formulated  in ASO4 adjuvant. Vaccination with Cervarix has been shown to protect women against a high  proportion of precursor lesions of cervical cancer caused by these two HPV types. This review  explores the various features of this new vaccine candidate and discusses the future directions  in the ﬁ eld of HPV vaccine development. Keywords: HPV, L1, VLP, vaccine, Cervarix Introduction Cervical cancer continues to be a major health care problem worldwide. Cervical  cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women in developing countries,  although cytological screening programs have substantially reduced its toll in devel- oped countries (Parkin et al 1999). It is known that oncogenic human papillomaviruses  (HPVs) are the primary causal agent of cervical cancer (Walboomers et al 1999).  More than 99% of cervical cancers and over 90% of their precursor lesions, squamous  intra-epithelial lesions (SIL), contain HPV DNA (Walboomers et al 1999). Although  more than 200 genotypes of HPV have been identiﬁ ed, a small number of genotypes  are highly associated with cancer, especially HPV16 and HPV18 (de Villiers et al  2004). These are termed “high-risk” types and are frequently associated with SIL  (also called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]), the precursor lesions of cervical  cancer (for review see Roden and Wu (2006)). HPVs are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses, with a circular, double-stranded  DNA genome. The genome of this small DNA virus encodes two classes of genes;  early and late. The early gene products regulate viral DNA replication (E1, E2), viral  RNA transcription (E2), cytoskeleton reorganization (E4) and cell transformation  (E5, E6, E7), whereas the late proteins (L1, L2) are structural components of the viral  capsid. Expression of the viral proteins is tightly regulated and associated with the  differentiation of infected epithelial cells. E2 is the master regulator that regulates  the expression of all the other viral genes, and is particularly involved in the repres- sion of E6 and E7. The viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are responsible for transforma- tion. During progression, the HPV genome integrates into the host chromosomal  DNA, leading to the disruption of the viral E2 gene and an inability to express the  late genes associated with high grade disease. Since E2 is a transcriptional repressor 

Biologics: Targets & Therapy 2008:2(1) 108 Monie et al of E6 and E7, loss of E2 leads to upregulation of E6 and  E7 genes. The elevated expression of E6 and E7 proteins  results in the disruption of cell cycle regulation and leads to  genomic instability, thereby contributing to the progression  of HPV-associated cervical cancer. Notably, their expression  is necessary to maintain the transformed phenotype (for a  review, see zur Hausen (2002)). A thorough knowledge of these concepts of HPV virology  is essential for the rational development of vaccines against  HPV. Vaccination could be implemented in the form of  preventive vaccines, which generate neutralizing antibodies  to block HPV viral infection or in the form of therapeutic  vaccines, which eliminate infection by inducing a virus- speciﬁ c T cell-mediated response. Current strategies for the  development of safe and effective preventive vaccines are  based on the induction of neutralizing antibodies against  the major and minor capsid proteins, L1 and L2 of human  papillomavirus. The newly licensed preventive HPV vac- cine, Gardasil® (Merck and Co, Inc.), which is an L1-based  vaccine, has both a remarkable safety proﬁ le and clinical  efﬁ cacy against the HPV genotypes from which it was  derived. Continued efforts are being made in the ﬁ eld of  L1-based vaccines in order to improve their efﬁ cacy, by  increasing the breadth of protection and reducing the cost  of these vaccines for wider access and effective prevention  of HPV infections. L1-based vaccines The expression of recombinant L1 in mammalian (Hagensee  et al 1993; Heino et al 1995), insect (Kirnbauer et al 1992;  Rose et al 1994), yeast (Sasagawa et al 1995), and even bacte- rial cells (Nardelli-Haeﬂ iger et al 1997) was shown to gener- ate virus-like particles (VLPs), which were morphologically  and immunologically similar to native virions (Kirnbauer  et al 1992; Rose et al 1994). Studies in various animal models  showed that these L1 VLPs induced high titers of neutraliz- ing serum antibodies, speciﬁ cally immunoglobulin G (IgG),  and protected against cutaneous or mucosal papillomavirus  challenge. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that L1 VLPs  are immunogenic and protective, and this protection is medi- ated by L1-speciﬁ c neutralizing antibodies (Breitburd et al  1995; Suzich et al 1995; Christensen et al 1996; Kirnbauer  et al 1996). Interestingly, vaccination with L1 capsomeres,  the pentameric subunit of VLPs, is also protective (Yuan  et al 2001), but not as immunogenic as VLPs in the absence  of adjuvants. Clinical trials were conducted using HPV L1 VLPs and  vaccination with these VLPs produced using baculovirus was  shown to be well tolerated and highly immunogenic (Evans  et al 2001; Harro et al 2001). The HPV16 L1 VLP vaccines  induced serum antibody titers that were about 40-fold higher  than the level observed in natural infection even without  an adjuvant and these antibodies were highly neutralizing  (Evans et al 2001; Harro et al 2001). Similar results were  observed using L1 VLPs derived from other HPV types  (Evans et al 2001; Ault et al 2004; Brown et al 2004; Fife  et al 2004). In 2002, a landmark clinical trial was conducted  by Koutsky et al which showed that vaccination with  HPV16 L1 VLPs formulated in the adjuvant alum provided  100% protection from the natural acquisition of persistent  HPV16 infection over an average of 17.4 months (Koutsky  et al 2002). Importantly, all nine cases of incident HPV16- related CIN were conﬁ ned to the placebo group, indicating  that vaccination protects against HPV-related disease. This  high degree of efﬁ cacy of L1 VLP vaccines for protection  against persistent infection and cervical disease relating to  the same HPV type infection has also been shown in other  clinical studies (Harper et al 2004; Harper et al 2006; Mao  et al 2006; Villa et al 2006a; Villa et al 2006b, Paavonen  et al 2007). Thus, the steady progress in the ﬁ eld of L1 VLP  vaccines led to the development of two successful vaccine  candidates. Cervarix™ Cervarix™ (GlaxoSmithKline) has already been approved in  the Europe and Australia and is currently under review by  the US Food and Drug Administration. Cervarix is a L1 VLP  vaccine that includes HPV types 16 and 18, the two major  serotypes that are involved with cervical cancer. Thus, the  vaccine has been developed to protect against infection from  the two major cancer-causing types of HPV; HPV16 and 18,  which together are responsible for approximately 70% of  all cervical cancers (de Villiers 1989). It has been produced  using insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus  and formulated in the proprietary adjuvant ASO4, which  consists of alum combined with a TLR4 ligand, MPL (3-O- desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid A). The vaccine requires  three intramuscular doses. The crucial efﬁ cacy endpoints  have been protection from HPV-related SIL and persistent  HPV infection by the HPV types used to derive the vaccine.  Results of efﬁ cacy trials have indicated that the vaccines  are well tolerated, highly immunogenic, and capable of  generating high titers of neutralizing antibody to the HPV  types 16 and 18, that are included in the vaccine, thus result- ing in a high efﬁ cacy against CIN2+ lesions containing HPV  16 and HPV 18 (Harper et al 2004; Paavonen et al 2007). 

Biologics: Targets & Therapy 2008:2(1) 109 The new HPV preventive vaccine, Cervarix In a recent report on a phase III double-blind, randomized  controlled trial, Cervarix demonstrated an efﬁ cacy of 90.4%  against CIN2+ lesions containing HPV 16 and 18 (Paavonen  et al 2007). There is also some amount of cross-protection  with the HPV types 31 and 45, thus leading to protection  against approximately 80% of cervical cancers (Harper  et al 2006). In addition, these vaccines have been shown to  be effective over a 5-year period (Harper et al 2006; Gall  et al 2007). Issues regarding Cervarix Although it has been established that Cervarix has an excel- lent safety proﬁ le and demonstrates signiﬁ cant protection  against persistent infection with both HPV 16 and HPV 18  infections, there are some concerns regarding various aspects  of the vaccine. Many of these issues are also applicable to  Gardasil. Type-restricted protection Cervarix has been developed to protect against infection  from HPV types 16 and 18, which together cause approxi- mately 70% of all cervical cancers. Furthermore, HPV16 and  HPV31, and HPV18 and HPV45 have very closely related  genotypes (for review see Roden and Wu 2006; Roden et al  2007), suggesting that vaccination with Cervarix may provide  cross-protection against HPV types 31 and 45. Indeed, vac- cination with Cervarix has been shown to generate partial  cross-protection against HPV types 31 and 45 (Harper et al  2006). However, the overall protection against cervical  cancer provided by Cervarix is probably only up to 80%  since this vaccine provides little or no protection against  other high-risk HPV types, such as HPV33, HPV52 and  HPV58 (Harper et al 2006). Furthermore, cross-protection  may not last as long as protection against the type included  in the vaccine. An important approach to resolve the issue of type- restricted protection is the employment of multivalent vac- cines, which has been implemented in a number of licensed  vaccines against other pathogens. However, this raises the  cost and complexity of manufacture with progressively  decreasing returns. The implementation of multivalent VLP  vaccines will require that there is no interference with the  responses compared to vaccination with individual types. It  has been suggested that a vaccine comprising the eight most  prevalent HPV types detected in cancer might be required  for 90% protection against cervical cancer, assuming  complete type-speciﬁ city of protection (Munoz et al 2004).  However, given partial cross-protection, this number is  probably an over-estimate. The oncogenic HPV types that  are present in different parts of the world are relatively  consistent, which suggests that such a multivalent vaccine  would be useful worldwide (Clifford et al 2005). Merck is  currently testing an octavalent HPV VLP vaccine targeting  6 oncogenic HPV types and is likely to at least partially  cover several related HPV types. An alternative approach to highly multivalent vac- cine preparations for broad protection is the employment  of a conserved and cross-protective antigen, such as L2.  Vaccination with the minor capsid protein L2 has been shown  to induce broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies in animal  models and has shown promise in this regard (Roden et al  2000; Embers et al 2002; Gambhira et al 2007). Therefore,  efforts to improve the immunogenicity of L2 and develop- ment for clinical testing of L2 vaccines are underway. The  ability to produce L2 in Escherichia coli and the potential to  use a single antigen suggest that L2 vaccines have potential  as a low cost alternative or complement to the L1 VLP vac- cines. Clinical trials are currently being planned to evaluate  the safety of HPV L2 polypeptide vaccination in healthy  women. Length of protection Although the duration of protection generated by Cervarix is  not clear at this point, recently available data has indicated  that Cervarix is highly efﬁ cacious against HPV-16/18 up to  5.5 years and prevents most CIN2+ lesions, and also shows  continued cross-protection against HPV-45 and HPV-31  incident infections (Gall et al 2007). Similar data are avail- able for Gardasil. It will be important to continue to follow  the same group of patients over time in order to acquire a  comprehensive picture of the length of protection. Age of vaccination In a recent phase III trial using Cervarix in healthy volun- teers of different age groups, higher antibody levels were  observed in the pre-teen/adolescent group compared to those  observed in women 15–25 years old (Pedersen et al 2007).  This indicates that the elevated levels demonstrated in this  younger age range may result in longer duration of protection.  Similarly, another study using the quadrivalent HPV L1 VLP  vaccine demonstrated robust anti-HPV neutralizing antibody  responses that were signiﬁ cantly higher in 10- to 15-year- old girls and boys compared to 16- to 23-year-old females  (Block et al 2006). For optimal effect, it is critical to vacci- nate adolescents against infection with cancer-causing HPV  types 16/18 well before the initiation of sexual activity with a 

Biologics: Targets & Therapy 2008:2(1) 110 Monie et al vaccine of sustained efﬁ cacy. The current recommended age  group of vaccination for Cervarix is 10–25 years. Limitations in low resource areas An important limitation of Cervarix is its high cost  compared to other vaccines, which is also true in case of  Gardasil. Since cervical cancer has a high prevalence in  developing countries, vaccines need to be made available  in low-resource areas in order to impact the incidence  of cervical cancer worldwide. Cervarix is expected to  cost about US$100 per dose and Gardasil costs US$120  per dose in the US. Both these vaccines require three  doses to complete the vaccination regimen. Thus, these  vaccines may not be ideal for low-resource areas and in  developing countries. Dramatically tiered pricing would  be necessary for their implementation. Furthermore, these  vaccines require refrigeration for storage, which might be  problematic in remote and low-resource areas. Thus, in  low-resource settings, the relative beneﬁ ts of these vaccines  may be restricted by poor coverage. In order to generate  impact on the incidence of cervical cancer, it is therefore  necessary to develop cost-effective, stable and effective  preventive vaccines that are capable of inducing broader  protection against most HPV types and which are suitable  for low-resource areas. Although current L1 VLP vaccines, Cervarix and Gar- dasil are produced in insect cells and yeast respectively,  higher levels of production of the vaccine in E. coli may  be a cheaper alternative. The expression of L1 in E. coli  produces high levels of capsomers (Li et al 1997; Rose  et al 1998; Chen et al 2000) and vaccination with such  capsomers induces neutralizing antibodies (Rose et al 1998;  Fligge et al 2001) and protects dogs from experimental  canine oral papillomavirus challenge (Yuan et al 2001).  In addition, the L1 capsomere vaccine is likely stable at  ambient temperatures. However, its immunogenicity rela- tive to VLPs is unclear. Clinical trials are currently being  planned to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of L1  capsomere vaccines formulated in alum. Alternatively, the  inclusion of L1 in other vaccines, such as typhoid, tubercu- losis or measles vaccines might represent a cost-effective  and practical alternative that could also provide immunity  to HPV (Reuter et al 2002; Baud et al 2004a,b; Govan et al  2006). In addition, the use of live vectors for the delivery  of L1 VLPs is attractive in remote and low-resource areas  as immunity could be spread, but safety remains an issue  with such vectors. Thus, further steps need to be taken in  order to improve the cost effectiveness of HPV vaccines  for successful implementation in low resource areas where  they are most needed. The requirement for needles and current three-dose regi- men for the current VLP vaccines also presents a formidable  obstacle to the delivery of these vaccines in low-resource  areas. Many possible needle-free alternatives, including  nasal inhalation and transdermal vaccination are being  considered as feasible options (Nardelli-Haefliger et al  2005; Rechtsteiner et al 2005). The regimen also presents  a problem in low-resource areas where regular follow-up is  highly unlikely. Thus, it is important to develop a vaccine  formulation that does not require three doses to generate  protective humoral immunity. Lack of therapeutic beneﬁ t An important obstacle to the rapid elimination of cervical  cancer is the current prevalence of established HPV infec- tions and HPV-associated disease. The existing HPV L1 VLP  vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix do not generate therapeutic  effect against pre-existing HPV infection. Since infected  basal epithelial cells and cervical cancers cells do not express  detectable levels of capsid antigen (L1 and/or L2), preven- tive HPV vaccines targeting L1 and/or L2 are unlikely to be  effective in the elimination of pre-existing infection and HPV- related disease. This is a serious concern since there is cur- rently a considerable burden of HPV infections worldwide. It  is estimated that it would take approximately 20 years from  the implementation of mass vaccination for highly effective  preventive vaccines to impact the cervical cancer rates due  to the prevalence of a signiﬁ cant population with existing  HPV infections and slow process of carcinogenesis. Thus,  in order to accelerate the control of cervical cancer and treat  currently infected patients, it remains important to develop  therapeutic vaccines against HPV in addition to improving  the efﬁ cacy of preventive vaccines such as Cervarix. Comparisons between Cervarix  and Gardasil Cervarix serves as an important competitive product relative  to the recently licensed L1-based preventive HPV vaccine,  Gardasil (FDA 2006a, b). Table 1 discusses the various  aspects of comparison between the two vaccines. Gardasil  is a quadrivalent vaccine that includes HPV types 6, 11,  16 and 18. The types 16 and 18 are major high-risk HPV  types, while the types 6 and 11 are the low-risk HPV types  that are associated with a majority of benign genital warts  and laryngeal papillomas. In comparison, Cervarix includes  only the two most important high-risk types, HPV 16 and 18. 

Biologics: Targets & Therapy 2008:2(1) 111 The new HPV preventive vaccine, Cervarix Thus, Gardasil can be used to prevent not only a majority  of cervical cancers, but also genital warts, one of the most  common sexually transmitted diseases. The inclusion of HPV6 and 11 VLPs has been used to help  justify vaccination of men, who do not get cervical cancer. Men  suffer from HPV-related cancer (including anal, penile, head,  and neck cancers) at a lower frequency than women because  of the predominance of cervical cancer. This suggests that that  cost/beneﬁ t ratio is questionable for men since efﬁ cacy in men has  not yet been demonstrated. The argument that men should be vac- cinated to provide herd immunity is also not so strong because the  vaccine is so effective in women, suggesting that ensuring broad  protection in women would be more cost-effective. However, if  only women are vaccinated, then there would be little impact on  HPV prevalence in men who have sex with men. Anal cancer is  a signiﬁ cant problem, particularly for this population. Furthermore, Gardasil is produced in recombinant yeast,  whereas Cervarix is produced using insect cells, but this does  not seem to affect the immunogenicity of the VLPs. One can  imagine that individuals that are allergic to yeast can turn to  Cervarix as an alternative option and vice versa. Another difference between Cervarix and Gardasil is  the adjuvant used in the formulation of the ﬁ nal product.  Gardasil uses Merck’s alum-based adjuvant. In contrast,  Cervarix uses the proprietary adjuvant developed by GSK,  ASO4. The formulation of Cervarix with the ASO4 adju- vant has been shown in clinical trials to induce a stronger  antibody response against HPV types 16 and 18 compared  to the same vaccine formulated with aluminium salt alone  (Giannini et al 2006). However, head-to-head trials with  Gardasil would be needed to conﬁ rm this observation. In  addition, a higher frequency of HPV L1-speciﬁ c B cells  was observed in individuals immunized with this bivalent  L1 vaccine formulated with ASO4 adjuvant compared to  the same vaccine formulated with alum. While the anti- body responses generated by Cervarix vaccine may be  higher than that generated by Gardasil, it is not clear if the  observed enhanced humoral immune response translates  into a stronger efﬁ cacy or longer duration of protection  compared to Gardasil. It would be important to determine  if the employment of different adjuvants will inﬂ uence the  duration of protection of the two vaccines. Conclusions Cervarix, represents yet another success in the develop- ment of preventive HPV vaccines. Similar to Gardasil,  Cervarix also has an excellent safety proﬁ le and high clini- cal efﬁ cacy, possibly protecting against up to 75%–80%  of all cervical cancers if the vaccine is fully implemented.  Although Cervarix has many similarities to Gardasil, there  are also several unique factors that are highlighted, such  as the adjuvant formulation, the production system and  the HPV types included. The inclusion of the proprietary  ASO4 adjuvant in Cervarix has led to a stronger immune  response in vaccinated individuals, although it is not clear  if this will lead to greater efﬁ cacy or longer duration of  protection. However, Cervarix, like Gardasil is mainly  available in developed countries. Thus, these vaccines are  unlikely to reach the people in the low-resource areas, who  need them the most. Since more than 80% of all cervical  cancer deaths occur in developing countries that lack the  resources and infrastructure for cytologic screening and  intervention, it is essential to make signiﬁ cant efforts to  develop cost-effective vaccines that are stable and can be  administered in a simple regimen (heat-stable, needle-free,  single vaccination) and thus can be effectively employed  Table 1 Comparisons between Cervarix and Gardasil Category Cervarix Gardasil HPV types Included HPV 16 and 18 HPV 16, 18, 6, 11 Production system Insect cells infected  with recombinant  baculovirus Yeast Adjuvant ASO4 (aluminium salt  + MPL (3-O-desacyl- 4'-monophosphoryl  lipid A)) Alum Diseases covered Anogenital cancers,  including cervical,  vulval, vaginal, and  anal cancers and their  associated precursor  lesions (and a subset  of head and neck  cancers) Anogenital cancers,  including cervical,  vulval, vaginal, and  anal cancers and their  associated precursor  lesions (and a subset of  head and neck cancers)  Genital warts and  laryngeal papillomas Available data regard- ing Length of protec- tion 5.5 years At least 5 years Dose 0.5 mL dose containing  20 μg HPV 16 L1 and  20 μg HPV18 L1 0.5 mL dose contain- ing 20 μg HPV6 L1,  40 μg HPV 11 L1,  40 μg HPV16 L1 and  20 μg HPV18 L1 Recommended admin- istration Route and  regimen Three intramuscular  injections at 0, 1, and  6 months Three intramuscular  injections at 0, 2, and  6 months Recommended age  group for vaccination 10–25 9–26 Price (US$) Approx. $100 per dose Approx. $120 per dose

Finally,  since HPV also contributes to a large proportion of other  cancers, including head and neck, vaginal, vulvar, anal,  and penile cancers, it will be of interest to determine if  these HPV vaccines are effective in protecting against  these cancers as well.
