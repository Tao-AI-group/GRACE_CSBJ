Introduction Human papillomavirus is the most com- mon sexually transmitted infection, and  skin-to-skin genital contact is sufficient for  virus transmission. Cervical cancer is the second-most com- mon cancer in women living in less developed  regions, with an estimated 445,000 new cases  in 2012 and 230,000 deaths every year. Until  now, more than 200 types of HPV have been  identified, and about 15 types (HPV-16,  -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56,  -58, -59, -66, -68, -82) have been shown to  cause cervical cancer because they are able  to transform infected cells into malignant  tumor cells. The bivalent vaccine containing  the serotypes 16 and 18 and the quadrivalent  vaccine containing the serotypes 16, 18, 6 and  11, have been used in Italy for many years.  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) au- thorized marketing of the Gardasil 9 vaccine  in the European Union on June 2015. Today,  Public Health targets the immunization of  adolescents of both genders based on new and  important scientific evidence for maximum  protection from all HPV related pathologies  directly preventable with vaccination. Papillomavirus is a relatively small virus  containing circular double-stranded DNA  belonging to the Papillomaviridae family,  which replicate their genomes by using the  host’s enzymatic machinery. HPVs infect 

29 Human Papillomavirus: epidemiology and prevention the cutaneous epithelium (skin) and mucosal  epithelium (e.g. cervical and other anogeni- tal mucosae). Generally, lesion formations,  like micro-wounds or micro-abrasions, on  the surface of the epithelium allow the virus  to enter and insert the viral genome into the  basal cells. The virus uses the host’s cells  to replicate viral DNA and express virally  encoded proteins, so new virus particles are  assembled and released in the cervical canal.  The deregulation of the host’s gene expres- sion leads to abnormal growth of squamous  cells on the surface of the cervix (1). During the process of cervical carcino- genesis the cervix is infected with HPV.  Infection may cause mild Pap abnormali- ties and/or mild cervical intraepithelial  neoplasia (CIN), which usually disappear  spontaneously. The persistence of high-risk HPV is a key  factor in precancerous lesions or high-grade  dysplasia (CIN 2/3) progression, which has a  greater likelihood of progressing to invasion  and cancer (2). In the precancer phase the  probability of returning to a normal cervix  is 57% in the presence of CIN 1, 43% with  CIN 2 and only 32% with CIN 3. If CIN 3  persists for more than 20 years the risk of  invasion and likelihood of a cervical cancer  is higher. Worldwide, 570,000 cases in fe- males and 60,000 in males are attributable  to HPV annually, which markedly represent  8.6% and 0.8% of all cancer cases occurring  globally (3). The prevalence of HPV was  estimated at 157,897 women with normal  cytology worldwide in a meta-analysis  study published in 2007. On all continents,  HPV-16 is most common with an estimated  point prevalence of 2.6% (95% CI: 2.5–2.8),  followed by HPV-18 in Europe, Central  and South America (4). The prevalence of  HPV by age groups and continent, includ- ing both high and low-risk types, is up to  30% in young women in all regions except  in Asia. The prevalence declines in middle- aged groups, and a second rise is observed  in women in the 35-44 or 45-54-year age  groups. Instead, in an HPV (any type)  prevalence study in men residing in Brazil,  Mexico and the USA in 2009, age does not  appear to be as strongly associated with HPV  prevalence or duration of infection in men,  as it typically affects women (5). A 9-valent  vaccine has been recently developed contain- ing serotypes 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 in addition to  serotypes 6, 11, 16, 18. Epidemiological data  from HPV infection in Italy also emphasizes  the importance and possible role of this vac- cine. The burden of diseases attributable to  HPV in Italy is shown by 2,918 new cases of  cervical cancer, 2,065 cases of neck cancer  in both genders, and about 100 new cases  of penile cancer per year. Mortality data  for all HPV cancers is still high, despite the  service of free pap-test screening for uterine  cervix cancer prevention. Cervix cancer has  a case to death ratio of 24% within 5 years.  It significantly increases up to 75% in both  genders for oropharynx cancer; the highest  rate is observed in anal cancer at 86% in  women and 89% in men, meaning that after  5 years only 14% of affected women and  11% of the affected men survive (6). In the classification of most oncogenic  viral papilloma serotypes, at the first and  second places are 16 and 18, respectively,  and responsible for cancer of the cervix,  vulva, vagina, penis, anus and oropharynx.  In the third place of frequency are serotypes  6 and 11, which are associated with a minor  oncogenic risk of the vagina and penis, but  are fourth in vulvar cancer and fifth in anus  cancer. The bivalent vaccine containing  serotypes 16 and 18, and the quadrivalent  vaccine containing serotypes 16, 18, 6 and  11, have been in use in Italy for many years.  There are other serotypes: 31, 33, 45, 52 and  58, with less oncogenic power. On average,  they are in the last position, but are equally  important because, for example, serotype 33  is second in oropharyngeal cancer and third  in cervical, vulvar and anus cancer. For this  reason, a 9-valent vaccine has been recently  developed, adding these last serotypes to 

30 I. Manini et al. the first four serotypes (7). Gardasil was  the first HPV vaccine to be authorized by  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in  September 2006 for the European Union,  while Cervarix was authorized exactly one  year later. Both vaccines are constituted by  an L1 surface antigen of the human papil- loma viruses. Gardasil is a quadrivalent  VLP (virus like particles) vaccine consisting  of serotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18, adjuvanted  with AAHS aluminum salts (amorphous  aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulphate) (8).  Cervarix is a bivalent VLP vaccine consist- ing of serotypes 16 and 18, adjuvanted with  aluminum salts AS04 (Al (OH)3) (9). Due to the severity of infections and the  high mortality rate of some forms of cancer,  a new 9-valent vaccine has been developed  containing also serotypes 31, 33, 45, 52 and  58, with a double adjuvant dose compared  to Gardasil in order to extend the spectrum  of protection. The possible cross-protection  of serotypes not present in the bivalent vac- cine has also been studied, since serotype  16 is very close to 31 from a phylogenetic  point of view, similar to serotypes 18 to 45.  The cross-protection study showed that after  4 years of vaccination a cross-protection  against serotypes 31, 33 and 45 is present,  and after 6.4 years of protective efficacy is  no longer significant (10). The Gardasil 9  vaccine was granted marketing authorization  in the EU on the 10th of June 2015 (11). Five main clinical studies demonstrate  the benefits of the vaccine. The first study, a  phase III study, conducted on 14,000 females  aged 16 through 26 years looked at the ef- fectiveness of Gardasil 9. This study showed  that only 1 out of 6,016 women vaccinated  with 3 doses of Gardasil 9 developed dis- eases related to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52 and  58, compared to 30 out of 6,017 who were  vaccinated with 3 doses of Gardasil (12). In  the second study, 3,066 subjects between  9 and 15 years of age, both females and  males, confirmed the effects of the vaccine.  The study demonstrated that the vaccine  stimulates the production of adequate levels  of antibodies against HPV for all 9 viral  types, in girls and boys between the ages of  9 and 15 when compared with women 16- 26 years of the first study. The third study  looked at the development of antibodies  one month after the third dose in 600 girls  aged 9 to 15 years. The study showed that  girls vaccinated with Gardasil 9 have similar  levels of protection against types 6, 11, 16  and 18 as girls vaccinated with Gardasil.  The fourth main study conducted in 1,419  young men and 1,101 young women aged 16  to 26 found that Gardasil 9 stimulates similar  levels of protection against all 9 virus types  in both young men and women one month  after the third dose. The last study looked  at the development of antibodies one month  after the last dose in two-dose schedule of  Gardasil 9 compared to three-dose vaccina- tion schedule.  The adverse events most observed in  the studies were local pain at the injection  site and headache. These side effects were  generally of mild to moderate intensity. The  Gardasil 9 vaccine may be administered con- comitantly with a recall vaccine containing  diphtheria (d) and tetanus (t), together with  the pertussis (acellular) and / or poliomyeli- tis (IPV): dTap, dT-IPV, DTap-IPV vaccines,  and the meningococcal conjugated vaccine  (MCV4), with no significant interference  in antibody response for both vaccines (13,  14). An epidemiological study conducted in  Europe in 2015 tried to estimate the benefits  of the 9-valent vaccine against the 4-valent.  The results show that the 9-valent vaccine  can cover 19% more cervical cancers than  the 4-valent vaccine, and vaccine coverage  is estimated at 75% regarding precancerous  lesions of the vagina, vulva, cervix and anus  (15, 16). Since 2007/2008 in all regions of  Italy, the HPV vaccination has been free  and actively offered to all girls at twelve  years of age. In the New National Vaccinal  Prevention Plan 2017-2019 (PNPV 2017-

31 Human Papillomavirus: epidemiology and prevention 2019) and in the new essential levels of assis- tance (LEA), free vaccination is also offered  to 12-year old males. The 9-valent vaccine  is aligned with the new Public Health objec- tive, offering anti-HPV vaccination to males  and females for maximum protection from  all related HPV diseases which are directly  preventable with vaccination, as expressed  in the New PNPV 2017-2019 (17). Although  vaccine coverage in females shows a decline  in recent years (from 64.59% in 2002 to  56.26% in 2003, with a complete vaccination  cycle) the PNPV 2017-2019 aims to achieve  75% vaccine coverage in 2018 and 95% in  2019 for males. Riassunto Epidemiologia e prevenzione del Papillomavirus  umano Il virus del papilloma umano si trasmette più comu- nemente per via sessuale, il contatto della pelle e delle  mucose genitali è sufficiente per la trasmissione del  virus. Il cancro del collo dell’utero è il secondo tumore  più diffuso nelle donne che vivono in regioni meno svi- luppate, con circa 445.000 nuovi casi nel 2012 e 230.000  morti ogni anno. Fino ad oggi sono stati identificati più  di 200 tipi di HPV e circa 15 tipi (HPV-16, -18, -31,  -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, 58, -59, -66, -68, -82)  possono causare il cancro della cervice perché sono in  grado di trasformare le cellule infette in cellule tumorali  maligne. Il vaccino bivalente contenente i sierotipi 16 e  18 e il vaccino quadrivalente contenente i sierotipi 16,  18, 6 e 11 sono usati in Italia da molti anni. Nel giugno  2015 l’Agenzia Europea per i Medicinali ha autorizzato  la commercializzazione del vaccino HPV 9-valente  nell’Unione Europea. Il vaccino anti-HPV 9-valente è  attualmente il vaccino anti-papilloma virus umano con  la più alta copertura. Questo nuovo vaccino, in linea con  il nuovo obiettivo di Sanità Pubblica per la vaccinazione  anti-HPV vuole offrire agli adolescenti di entrambi i  sessi la massima protezione da tutte le patologie HPV  correlate, così come espresso nel nuovo Piano Nazionale  di Prevenzione Vaccinale 2017-2019.
