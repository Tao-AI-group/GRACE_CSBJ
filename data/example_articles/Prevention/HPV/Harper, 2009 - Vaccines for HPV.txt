1663 Review www.expert-reviews.com ISSN 1476-0584 © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd 10.1586/ERV.09.123 Within the last three decades, human papil­ lomavirus (HPV) infection has been found to  be necessary but not sufficient for the devel­ opment of cervical cancer [1]. Cytologic and  histo­logic correlations with cervical cancer  were initially described contemporaneously by  zur Hausen [2] and by Meisels and Fortin [3,4],  with a rapid subsequent increase in knowl­ edge both in the human and animal papillo­ maviruses. zur Hausen continued to elucidate  the oncogenic mechanisms of HPV for which he  was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2008 [5]. Several  scientists continued to work to isolate and fabri­ cate the L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) [6], which  form the basis of the prophylactic HPV vaccines. Most HPV infections never progress to can­ cer, but the small fraction of HPV infections  that do become cervical cancer cause over  250,000 deaths annually worldwide [7]. HPV  infections are common and, most often but not  necessarily, are associated with sexual activity.  Multiple studies indicate that the rate of onco­ genic HPV infection is between 5 and 10% for  children prior to sexual activity [8–10]; the inci­ dence increases to 30% when women become  sexually active, decreases in their late 30s to  10% and increases again to 15% in women  over 60 years of age [11]. HPV vaccines offer  the potential to decrease the incidence rate of  HPV infection. Where secondary prevention  programs (e.g., Pap screening or HPV testing)  are not nationally organized, decreasing the  baseline rate of HPV infection should lead to  population-based reductions in cervical cancer  after several decades of widespread female vacci­ nation. Where secondary prevention programs  are vigorous and well-attended, prophylac­ tic vaccination should reduce the number of  diagnostic work-ups for abnormal screens and  decrease the need for excisional therapies for pre­ cancerous lesions in as little as 3 years after vac­ cinating a currently HPV-uninfected ­sexually  active population.  The two vaccines The two HPV vaccines, Cervarix® (Glaxo­ SmithKline, Middlesex, UK) and Gardasil®  (Silgard®; Merck & Co., Inc., NJ, USA), con­ tain a protein mimic of the L1 outermost protein  capsid (VLPs) specific to the two most common  HPV types causing cervical cancer, HPV-16 and  -18 (Table 1). Gardasil also includes the VLPs for  HPV-6 and -11, the most common HPV types  causing genital warts. Along with the HPV  type-specific VLPs, which direct the antibody  response, the vaccines contain an adjuvant whose  dual purpose is to prolong the immune response  for as long as possible with the smallest amount  of antigen (VLP) possible.  The primary mechanism of action of the pro­ phylactic vaccines is the anti-HPV L1 humoral  response [12], which has been proven in animal  studies to prevent acquisition and disease in  unvaccinated animals after a viral challenge.  Therefore, one of the goals of the prophylactic  vaccines is to induce a robust antibody response  that can only be achieved by combining the  ­antigen with an adjuvant.

Cervarix is effective against HPV-16, -18, -31, -33 and -45, the five most common  cancer-causing types, including most causes of adenocarcinoma for which we cannot screen  adequately. Gardasil is effective against HPV-16, 18 and 31, three common squamous cell  cancer-causing types. In addition, Gardasil is effective against HPV-6 and -11, causes of genital  warts and respiratory papillomatosis. The most important determinant of vaccine impact to  reduce cervical cancer is its duration of efficacy. To date, Cervarix’s efficacy is proven for 6.4 years  and Gardasil’s for 5 years.

Expert Rev. Vaccines 8(12), (2009) 1664 Review The adjuvant systems are different for each vaccine. Gardasil’s  system is based on the traditional general adjuvant principles  while Cervarix’s system is based on an adjuvant hypothesized to  be targeted to the specific receptors for HPV infection. Cervarix  contains monophosphoryl lipid A, a mimic of Toll-like receptor 4,  which is hypothesized to function as a link between viruses, such  as HPV, and the activation of the innate immune system. Having  primed the innate immune system, the antigen-presenting cells  stimulate the adaptive immune response by activating T cells, then  B cells. The B cells proliferate into plasma cells, immediately mak­ ing large quantities of antibody, and into memory B cells, which,  upon later stimulation, can reactivate the plasma cells to replenish  the neutralizing antibodies. This adjuvant system is called the  AS04 adjuvant system. The AS04 system provides higher titers  of antibodies than an aluminum adjuvant alone in humans, and  the titers remain elevated above aluminium-induced antibody tit­ ers for at least 48 months [13]. The adjuvant system for Gardasil  contains a proprietary aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate system  which, in mice, provides more superior binding to HPV-16 than a  simple aluminum adjuvant [14]. The results of the human trials for  these two novel HPV vaccines provides early data upon which to  design HPV-associated disease and cancer-prevention strategies.  Vaccine efficacy Both Cervarix and Gardasil have been found to be highly effica­ cious in preventing HPV-16/18-associated cervical intraepithelial  neoplasias (CINs) (Table 2) in women 15–16 years of age through  to 25–26 years of age who were seronegative and DNA negative at  study entry for the relevant HPV types associated with each vac­ cine. [15,16]. Table 2 delineates the differences in efficacy when the study  population changes either in terms of baseline characteristics, the  number of injections received or when the cases of CIN 2+ begin to  be counted (CIN 2+ means CIN 2, CIN 3, adenocarcinoma in situ,  cervical squamous cell carcinoma and/or cervical adenocarcinoma). The efficacy of Gardasil changes only slightly when the per-­ protocol (PP) population includes those who missed their injec­ tion at the specified protocol timing (protocol violations), as seen  in the unrestricted susceptible population.  Over 97% of the subjects received all three  doses within 1 year in FUTURE II [17], and  over 95% of the subjects received all three  doses within 1 year in FUTURE I [18]. The  95% efficacy seen in this population of  which the majority received all three doses  of vaccine within 1 year indicates that the  implementation regimen of the three doses  can be quite flexible within a 1-year span  without affecting the vaccine efficacy.  When women are included regardless  of baseline serologic and HPV status who  have received one or more injections (intent- to-treat [ITT] population), the efficacy of  Gardasil over an average of 36  months  falls to 44% against CIN 2+ caused by  HPV-16/18. By counting cases after day 1,  the data show that more than one dose of vaccine is necessary  to induce a high efficacy, and that the cases counted prior to a  full series of vaccination reflect infection and lesion development  occurring during the nonprotected state. This is important for  public-health tabulations of vaccine coverage – tabulating at least  one dose will not reflect any population efficacy; population cover­ age can only be estimated from those individuals receiving three  doses within 1 year. An additional decrease in efficacy is attrib­ uted to women already infected or who had already developed a  CIN lesion from one of the vaccine-relevant types at the time of  first vaccination.  Gardasil’s efficacy further falls to 18% for an average of  44 months in the ITT population when the cause of CIN 2+ can  be any HPV infection. This low efficacy from simulated real-life  populations is expected when evaluating efficacy against CIN 2+  caused by any HPV infection, as 50% of CIN 2+ lesions are  caused by high-risk types of HPV other than 16 and 18. Similarly,  an additional decrease in efficacy is also expected in the ITT  population reflecting conditions of an already actively infected  population: 20% of the baseline population were infected with  one of the vaccine-relevant HPV types at baseline, had serologic  evidence of prior exposure or entered the study with abnormal  cytology [17]. Uncharacteristically, however, the cross-protection  benefits seen in later Gardasil studies [19,20] are not reflected by  any increase in efficacy in this ITT calculation, questioning the  clinically measurable benefit of cross-protection by Gardasil.  In comparison to the 18% efficacy seen by Gardasil, the efficacy  of Cervarix in the naive total vaccinated cohort was 70% against  all CIN 2+ regardless of HPV causation, and 30% in the total  vaccinated cohort, which included those with current and past  HPV-16/18 infections. At this time, Cervarix and Gardasil show durations of efficacy  lasting 6.4 and 5 years, respectively, from the Phase II trial data  (Table 3), with Cervarix trials still ongoing. Gardasil Phase II trials  were stopped at 5 years. There are ongoing trials in Costa Rica,  the Netherlands, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden and Finland for both  Cervarix and Gardasil planned for at least 10 years [21–23].  Table 1. Vaccine composition.

www.expert-reviews.com 1665 Review Therapeutic efficacy It is important to establish with firm data, not just indirect evi­ dence, that neither Cervarix nor Gardasil offers any therapeutic  efficacy, nor any acceleration in viral clearance, nor any acceler­ ated progression to cervical cancer. The data available to date  are presented in Table 4, showing a lack of therapeutic efficacy in  women positive for a vaccine-relevant HPV infection at baseline.  Women who had a CIN lesion of any grade attributed to HPV-6,  -11, -16 and/or -18 at study entry did not clear their lesion within  3 years after three Gardasil injections [18], nor did they develop  an increased number of CIN 2+ lesions over the placebo group.  Likewise, in women who already had an  active HPV-16/18 infection at the time of  vaccination, there was no clearance of the  HPV-16/18 infection or acceleration to  CIN 2+ within 12 months with Cervarix  vaccination [24].  Baseline seropositivity The highest vaccine efficacies for Gardasil  and Cervarix are reported in women  15–26  years of age who are both sero­ negative and PCR negative for the relevant  vaccine types prior to vaccination. The  limited but statistically significant data  in Table 5 show that despite prior exposure  to HPV-16/18 (seropositivity), women  without active HPV-16/18 infection at the time of first vaccina­ tion continued to have 100% vaccine efficacy to prevent CIN  2+ caused by HPV-16/18. High efficacy in seropositive women  without active infection is important to vaccinating young girls,  approximately 10% of whom are already seropositive by 10 years  of age for at least HPV-16 from unknown causes [8–10], but with­ out active infection. Having confidence that the vaccines perform  at high efficacy rates despite prior infection alleviates concerns  that vaccine performance might be compromised when target­ ing a supposedly naive adolescent population that is not actually  completely naive. Serendipitously, the continued high efficacy of  Table 2. Phase III trial vaccine efficacies by human papillomavirus type causation and by cohort analysis.

Expert Rev. Vaccines 8(12), (2009) 1666 Review HPV vaccination in women 15–26 years of age who are already  seropositive but PCR negative supports targeting vaccination  to the newly sexually active population, a population far more  accepting of a sexually transmitted infection vaccination than the  parents of young adolescent girls [101]. This population of women  vaccinated within the first year of sexual activity has a greater  prevention of HPV-16/18 persistent infections and CIN 2+ dis­ ease within 3 years of vaccination in absolute rate reductions  (57/1000 women) than does vaccinating virgins prior to the onset  of their sexual activity (17/1000 women) [25].  Cross-protection Table 6 details the known data for the protection provided against  persistent infection of 6 months duration or longer, and for CIN 2+  lesions caused by high-risk types other than HPV-16 and -18 for  Cervarix and Gardasil. Cervarix provides individual cross-protec­ tion for HPV-31, -33 and -45 persistent infections [26]. Gardasil  provides protection against HPV-31. All of the cross-protection  provided by Gardasil in grouped classifications is due to the solo  strength of HPV-31 coverage [18]. Ongoing trials are evaluating  the efficacy of a pentavalent supplemental vaccine to Gardasil  explicitly containing HPV-31, -33, -45, -52 and -58 to broaden  Gardasil’s coverage with eventual replacement of Gardasil with the  nonovalent vaccine [102]. In the cross-protection studies, persistent  HPV infection outcomes are more appropriate than CIN 2+ end  points, as they unequivocally establish that infection has been  present for some time, in contrast to the incidental presence of an  HPV type in a lesion in which multiple types are also detected,  but not necessarily ­causative [27,28], which occurs in the majority  of CIN 2+ lesions [29]. Extrapolating potential reduction in cervi­ cal cancers from direct and cross-protection of the HPV vaccines  under assumptions of complete vaccine coverage, lifetime duration  of efficacy and clinically relevant efficacies, indicates that Cervarix  may reduce the incidence of both squamous and adenocarcinoma  of the cervix by 81% and Gardasil by 73% (Table 7).  Reductions in use of secondary screening Both Cervarix and Gardasil have reduced the number of women  referred to colposcopy for an abnormal Pap test by 26 and 20%,  respectively, within 3 years of vaccine use (Table 8) [26,30]. Because  of the additional cross-protection, Cervarix has prevented in  3 years 69% of the excisional therapies associated with reproduc­ tive morbidity compared with 42% for Gardasil [26,30]. The rate  of loop electrosurgical excision procedures in the USA is currently  500 per 100,000 women screened [31]; this could be reduced to  as low as 155 per 100,000 women with universal vaccination  coverage (Figure 1).  Protection beyond the cervix for Gardasil Table 9 details the efficacies against diseases not related to cervi­ cal cancer prevention. HPV-6 and -11 are the assumed cause of  90% of genital warts [32]. Vaccine efficacy for protection against  the development of condyloma caused by HPV-6, -11, -16 or  -18 in women 16–26 years of age lasting on average 44 months  was reported at 80% for the ITT population and 99% for the  PP population for Gardasil – both very high levels of efficacy  [103,104]. Inexplicably, however, one would expect the efficacy of  Gardasil against all condyloma regardless of HPV type to be  Table 4.

www.expert-reviews.com 1667 Review very similar to the efficacy against condyloma caused by HPV-6  and -11, the purported cause of 90% of genital warts. The data  show significantly less efficacy for condyloma caused by all HPV  types at 63%. Potentially the attributable proportion of HPV-6  and -11 for genital warts is not 90% as previously thought, but  actually much lower.  Protection against condyloma caused by HPV-6, -11, -16 or -18  in boys and men is 89% lasting for 29 months [33]. Unfortunately,  there are no reports of efficacy against all condyloma regardless of  HPV causation for males to date. We do not know whether there  is a similar significant decrease in overall condyloma prevention  in men as there is in women.  Table 6.

Expert Rev. Vaccines 8(12), (2009) 1668 Review Gardasil’s efficacy against vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia  (VIN) 1 caused by HPV-6, -11, -16 or -18 in an ITT popula­ tion was not significant after 36 months, trialed in a population  of almost 18,000 women [104]. Vaginal intraepithelial neopla­ sia (VaIN) 1 caused by HPV-6, -11, -16 or -18, on the other  hand, showed nonreassuring significant efficacy both in the PP  and the ITT populations as both had quite broad confidence  intervals [104]. Overall protection from VIN 1, VaIN 1 or condy­ loma caused by any HPV type was reported at 41% for the ITT  population. This overall efficacy is dominated by the protection  from condyloma as efficacies for VIN 1 and VaIN 1 contrib­ ute little to the overall protection of VIN 1/VaIN 1/condyloma  from any HPV type. Gardasil does not have national regulatory  approval for the prevention of VIN 1 or VaIN 1.  Gardasil’s efficacy against VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 caused by  HPV-16/18 after an average of 44 months of follow up is 100%  in the PP populations, with small overlapping decreases to 69 and  85%, respectively, in the ITT populations [103]. Both vaginal and  vulvar cancer precursors have limited asso­ ciation with HPV infection [34,35], explain­ ing the extremely wide efficacy confidence  intervals for VIN 2/3 from any cause and  no significant efficacy for VaIN 2/3 from  any cause [36]. While Gardasil is approved  for and has the potential to reduce vaginal  and vulvar cancers caused by HPV-16/18  by two-thirds of their current incidence, it  is unlikely that Gardasil will have a meas­ urable clinical effect on the prevention  of vaginal cancers from any cause overall  based on these nonsignificant data.  Duration of vaccine efficacy Cost–effectiveness analyses have indicated  that the vaccines must last at least 15 years  or longer, or there will not be any cases of  cervical cancer prevented – they will merely  be postponed [37–43]. If the vaccines are given  to an age group who is immediately sexually  active, then despite not preventing cervical  cancers, there will be some protection from  the precursor lesions and a reduction in  excisional treatments, which are linked to  reproductive morbidity [44,45]. If the vaccines  are given to the youngest ages approved, the  risk of no benefit of any protection is high  with a small risk of serious side effects.

www.expert-reviews.com 1669 Review Immunogenicity The purpose of the prophylactic HPV vac­ cines is to induce antibodies to the specific  vaccine-relevant HPV types that will be sus­ tained for the duration of time the woman  is susceptible to HPV infections. Both  Cervarix and Gardasil induce antibody  titers after three doses that far exceed the  titers a natural infection induces in women  16–26 years of age who were seronegative  and PCR negative for the vaccine-relevant  HPV types at baseline.  The antibody titers, measured in ELISA  units/ml, induced by Cervarix remain 13-  and 12-fold higher than natural infection  titers at 6.4 years for HPV-16 and -18, respec­ tively, with over 98% of the women vac­ cinated maintaining initial sero­conversion  through 6.4 years. An increased memory  B-cell response has been demonstrated in  women 18–30 years of age who were sero­ negative and PCR negative for HPV-16/18  at the time of vaccination at 1 month after  the three doses of Cervarix compared with  the HPV-16/18 VLPs adjuvanted with alu­ minum alone [13]. The pseudovirion-based  neutralization assay (PBNA, ED50 unit) tit­ ers for HPV-16 and -18 were likewise high  and sustained throughout 6.4 years, and cor­ related well with the ELISA titers. In addi­ tion, the PBNA titers correlated tightly with  the measured type-specific cervical mucous  antibodies transudating across the basement  membrane over 24 months. Antibody titers  induced by Cervarix measured in women  15–55 years of age were titers still eightfold  higher than natural infection titers for even  the oldest 46–55-year-old age cohort after  24 months [46]. The strong and sustained  immuno­genic properties of Cervarix offer  the possibility of long-term protection for  women of many ages. The neutralization antibody titers induced  by Gardasil have been measured by competi­ tive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) for each  HPV type 6, 11, 16 and 18 in milliMerck  units/ml. Over 99% of women serocon­ verted for each HPV type after three doses of vaccine. For HPV-18,  however, 28% of women lost their initial seroconversion at 2 years,  increasing to 35% of women losing their sero­conversion by 3 years.  Of those with remaining HPV-18 titers, the levels continued to  drop through the studies’ end. After an average of 44 months of  follow up, 40% of women lost all measurable antibody titers to  HPV-18. [47]. In over 14,000 women followed for at least 3 years,  there were only 60 cases of HPV-18 infection in the placebo arm for  a very low attack rate of less than five infections per 1000 woman- years in an age range of maximal HPV exposure. Such a low attack  rate does not allow inferences to be drawn about the duration of  the vaccine’s efficacy or the immunologic correlate of protection,  as there has not been much infectious challenge to the women’s  waning serostatus. Overall, 10% of women lost their antibody tit­ ers to HPV-6 and 5% lost them to HPV-11 within 44 months; of  those with remaining seropositivity, the titers dropped to natural  Table 9.

Expert Rev. Vaccines 8(12), (2009) 1670 Review infection titers by 24 months, opening the  possibility of waning protection. Strong  immunogenicity is seen for HPV-16. Over  98% of women maintained seroconversion  to HPV-16 and maintained titers tenfold  above natural infection titers at 44 months  (Figures 2, 3 & 4).  The neutralizing antibody titers to HPV- 16 and -18 have been measured in the same  assay in a head-to-head trial of Cervarix and  Gardasil [48] in order to remove the confu­ sion of different proprietary measure­ment  systems. In all circumstances, Cervarix pro­ duced significantly higher antibody titers for  HPV-16 than did Gardasil (3.7-fold higher)  at month 7, the peak titers; and even greater  fold higher for HPV-18 (7.3-fold higher).  As the duration of vaccine efficacy is the  most important public-health parameter  of mass vaccination programs, and because  antibody titers are the closest surrogate  measure to efficacy as evidenced by our use  of immunobridging, and despite not hav­ ing a correlative titer identified, it is likely  that Cervarix will have a longer duration  of efficacy than will Gardasil. Long-term  studies are necessary to prove this (Table 10).  The head-to-head trial also reported  cervico­vaginal mucous antibody tit­ ers present in the vaccinated women.  Cervicovaginal secretion mucous antibod­ ies are believed to be central for protection  against HPV infection and cervical disease,  evidenced by natural history studies in  which both IgA and IgG antibodies appear  several months after HPV clearance, with  the IgG antibody action predominating [49].  A similar proportion of HPV-specific neu­ tralizing antibodies transudates from the  serum to the mucous for both vaccines. The  ratios of titers in the serum to titers in the  mucous were threefold higher for Cervarix  than for Gardasil as measured by the PBNA. Memory B cells induced after Cervarix  and Gardasil were equivalent for HPV-16  measured at 1 month after the series of three  vaccinations at nearly 90%. For HPV-18,  nearly 90% of the women vaccinated with  Cervarix responded with memory B cells,  but only 66% of the women vaccinated  with Gardasil had so responded at the  time of maximal potential response. This  is another indicator of the potential neces­ sity for a booster for HPV-18 ­durability  by Gardasil. 100,000 10,000 1000 100 10 10,000 1000 100 10 Cervarix 6.4 years GMT (95% CI) Natural  infection  titer 11-fold higher HPV-16 Time since vaccination (months) Serum cLIA GMT, mMU/ml (log10 scale) 5 years Gardasil PBNA (ED50) M0 M7 M12 M18 M25 M33 M39 M45 M51 M57 M63 M69 M75 Subsequent titers after peak: HPV-16; 15–26-year-old females Cervarix® Placebo –32 –38 –44 –50 –56 –62 –68 –74 –76 67 12 18 24 30 36 54 60 Tenfold higher Gardasil® Placebo Baseline-seropositive and  PCR-negative placebo (NIT) 124 × 104 × Natural  infection  titer D1 23 * * * Figure 2.

www.expert-reviews.com 1671 Review An anamnestic response was elicited by  an intramuscular injection of a single dose  of Gardasil at the end of the 5-year Phase II  trial [50]. Antibodies to HPV-6 were induced  in 75% of women who had lost their HPV-6  seropositivity with only a third of the  responders mounting titers that exceeded  the initial antibody response. Antibodies to  HPV-11 were induced in 86% of women  who had lost their HPV-11 seropositivity,  with 70% of the responders mounting titers  that exceeded the initial antibody response.  This is worrisome that the boosted titers  were not completely regained after only  5 years between the initial series and the  booster injection. Antibodies to HPV-18  were induced in 97% of women who had  lost their HPV-18 seropositivity, with 73%  of the responders mounting titers that  exceeded the initial antibody response. It is  reassuring to note that the loss of HPV-18  efficacy may be regained by booster shots,  certainly within 5 years. The anamnestic  studies were not continued to show the  rate of decay in the response over time. It  is not known how the anamnestic response  will behave if the booster is not given until  10 years after the initial vaccination series.  HPV-16 immunogenicity remains strong  for Gardasil with anamnestic challenge.  There was only one woman who lost her  seropositivity to HPV-16 at 60 months,  and she responded to the booster shot with  titers above the initial antibody response  1 month after the booster. Since no trials  of Gardasil have been extended beyond  44  months for the Phase  III trials and  5 years for the Phase II trial, the meaning  of the loss of antibody titers is unclear for  possible future declines in vaccine efficacy.  Both Cervarix and Gardasil were tested in  young adolescents 9/10–15 years of age who  were seronegative at study entry for the vac­ cine-relevant HPV types for safety and anti­ body responses [51–54]. Both studies showed  that young adolescents mounted an anti­ body response that was significantly higher  than the response induced in 16–26-year- old seronegative, PCR-negative women. The  concept of immunobridging was invoked to  infer a similar efficacy for adolescent females  to that seen in the 16–26-year-old female  cohort because there was a similar or greater  immune response in the young adolescents  compared with the 16–26-year-old women.  100,000 10,000 1000 100 10 1000 100 10 Cervarix 6.4 years GMT (95% CI) Fivefold higher HPV-18 Time since vaccination (months) Serum cLIA GMT, mMU/ml (log10 scale) 5 years Gardasil PBNA (ED50) M0 M7 M12 M18 M25 M33 M39 M45 M51 M57 M63 M69 M75 Subsequent titers after peak: HPV-18; 15–26-year-old females Cervarix® Placebo –32 –38 –44 –50 –56 –62 –68 –74 –76 D1 67 12 18 24 30 36 54 60 Gardasil® Placebo Baseline-seropositive and  PCR-negative placebo (NIT) At NIT 27× 35% of Gardasil- vaccinated  women lose  their antibody  titers to HPV  by 3 years, 40%  by 5 years Natural  infection  titer Natural  infection  titer 107× * * * 23 Figure 3.

Expert Rev. Vaccines 8(12), (2009) 1672 Review Seropositive & PCR negative for HPV-6, -11, -16 & -18 Data from the Gardasil studies (Table 11) [103] show that the anti­ body titers for HPV-6, -11 and -18 (not HPV-16) measured at  30 months for the 9–12-year-old girls seronegative and PCR  negative to HPV-6, -11, -16 and -18 were half the titers present at  38–50 months for the 16–26-year-old seropositive women who  were PCR-negative for HPV-6, -11, -16 and -18 at study entry. On  the other hand, the antibody titers for HPV-16 were equivalent for  the 9–12-year-old girls and the 16–26-year-old seropositive, PCR- negative women at study end. If the concept of immunobridging  is to be believed, this evidence indicates that Gardasil should be  equally effective for 16–26-year-old sexually active young women  as it is assumed to be in the 9–12-year-old naive cohort, as neither  group has an actively replicating vaccine type-specific HPV infec­ tion. This will alleviate much of the social and cultural strife of  targeting a vaccine for a sexually transmitted infection to young  physiologically immature adolescents without removing the possi­ bility of being vaccinated at either a young age or an age postcoital  debut. As previously stated, data from the Costa Rica Vaccine  Trial supports this concept: protection from persistent HPV-16/18  infections and CIN 2+ disease caused by any HPV type was 57  per 1000 women in those women vaccinated within their first  year of sexual activity, whereas it was only 17 per 1000 women in  those women vaccinated as virgins who went on to become sexu­ ally active [25]. Given the tremendous negative attitude among  physicians and patients about Gardasil being marketed to girls  too young, there is excellent scientific evidence to emphasize the  benefits of vaccinating young women instead of adolescents [105,55]. Safety Safety documentation is a priority in all phases of the vaccine clin­ ical trials. Safety is categorized as local reactions from the injec­ tion itself and as systemic reactions that may occur throughout  the trials. The randomized, controlled trials are the appropriate  mechanism for determining safety in general for the regulatory  licensure process. Postlicensure surveillance is critically important  for population-based safety because the more rare adverse events  cannot be detected until millions of doses have been administered. In general, the randomized, controlled trials have shown that  both vaccines are safe for the vast majority of recipients when con­ sidering pregnancy-related outcomes, fetal and infant morbidity  and mortality, as well as new onset of chronic or autoimmune dis­ eases. However, serious adverse events do occur at a low frequency  that must be disclosed to the parents and young women prior  to vaccination. It is possible that with whole genome-scanning,  transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteinomics and newly associated  biostatistical approaches, individuals will be screened prior to vac­ cination to avoid serious adverse events (immunogenetics). Entire  populations may be classified by immunogenomics to identify  groups of people who are at the highest risk from serious adverse  events from vaccination. Despite low-frequency occurrences, the  fact that serious adverse events have been reported means that indi­ viduals, if not entire subpopulations, will be able to be identified  prior to vaccination for maximal vaccine safety [56]. The safety data for 10–14-year-olds were documented from a  study of 158 young adolescent girls for Cervarix, and from a study  of 1123 girls 9–15 years of age for Gardasil, both studies ending at  1 year after the three-dose series was completed [51,52,54]. The local  adverse events reported within the first 5–7 days after vaccination in  the adolescent ages included pain in 75–80%, erythema in 20–35%  and swelling in 20–30% of the recipients. These local adverse events  occurred in the same proportion in the 16–26-year-old women.  Systemic adverse events in the trials of adolescents and young  women were reported within 30 days of vaccination and then at  intermittent follow-up visits throughout the studies. The most  commonly reported adverse events were myalgias, arthralgias,  headaches and gastrointestinal symptoms, which occurred equally  often in those receiving the control injection [17,26].

www.expert-reviews.com 1673 Review The serious adverse events were those  medical events that resulted in hospitali­ zation, disability, congenital anomaly or  death. Only Gardasil has been subjected  to postmarketing surveillance through  the US-based Vaccine Adverse Events  Reporting System (VAERS), as Cervarix  has just been approved in the USA. The  VAERS has limitations. If a positive  association is found statistically between  the events and receiving Gardasil, the  association exists. However, the associa­ tion, ipso facto, does not mean causation.  Likewise, when no association is found in  the analysis of VAERS, there is no reas­ surance that an association is not present  as VAERS is insignificantly powered. Of  all the adverse events reported to VAERS,  Merck was responsible for 68%, an unu­ sually high proportion of reports coming  from industry rather than the physician,  patient, pharmacist or other reporter.  Frustratingly for the US FDA, 89% of the  reports Merck submitted did not contain  sufficient information for the US CDC to  evaluate; this includes four of the cases of  death [57]. Anaphylaxis has been reported at a rate  of 2.6 per 100,000 doses in an Australian  school-based national vaccination pro­ gram  [58]. Although rare and methodo­ logically disputed by critics [59], this inci­ dence rate is higher than that associated  with other routinely given vaccines in  this age group. The only published report  shows that syncope and venous thrombo­ embolism are occurring at frequencies  statistically higher than expected in the  general population [60]. FDA warnings  about syncope have been issued since 2007  to prevent the falls, contusions, fractures,  concussions, lacerations and intracerebral  hemorrhages that have ensued after loss  of consciousness.  The other remarkable serious adverse  events include 12 verifiable cases of  Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS),  which were confirmed by the Clinical  Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA)  network of six academic centers whose  mission is to research vaccine adverse  events [106]. Of these, nine cases mani­ fested within 41 days of vaccination, the  biologically plausible timeframe for GBS  to occur.

Expert Rev. Vaccines 8(12), (2009) 1674 Review where Menactra™ (MCV4) and Gardasil were coadministered.  A preliminary analysis by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC- sponsored surveillance group based at eight managed care organi­ zations throughout the USA, did not find a statistically significant  increased risk for GBS in persons who received Gardasil compared  with a historic reference population [107]. Nevertheless, Merck  has revised the quadrivalent and pentavalent HPV vaccine study  consent forms to include a possible low-frequency increased risk  of GBS in study participants. If there are multiple opportunities  to vaccinate young girls, it would seem wise to separate their vac­ cinations to different days, to lessen the likelihood of unknown  adverse interactions.  Less frequently occurring motor neuron diseases resulting in  permanent disability or death have been reported after Gardasil  use as well. These events are very rare, but the incidence of juve­ nile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the general popula­ tion, a uniformly fatal disease, is also very rare, at rates similar  to the incidence of reported ALS-like symptoms triggered after  Gardasil injection. There are four confirmed cases of ALS-like  syndromes after Gardasil injection, with two of the four girls  already dead [Shapiro B, Pers. Comm.]. Other rare demyelinating,  autoimmune diseases and other events have been reported in low  frequencies [61–68]. Pregnancy concerns Clinical recommendations for vaccine administration are split  into three conditions:  •	 Do not vaccinate a woman during pregnancy  •	 If she has received one dose prior to pregnancy, the series of  three doses can be restarted after delivery  •	 If she has received two doses prior to pregnancy, the final dose  can be given after delivery  There is no medical reason to interrupt a pregnancy owing to par­ tial vaccine administration. There are no contraindications to vacci­ nation during lactation. Some would suggest immediately starting  the vaccination series postpartum as an effective strategy to ensure  completion of the three doses as she will already be ­interacting  with the medical profession for her infant follow-up visits.

Maximal potential effect of screening, vaccination, both or neither on  the incidence of cervical cancer in the USA. The lowest incidence Pap screening can  achieve in the nonvaccinated population is two to three per 100,000 [76]. Currently, in  the USA, the Pap screening program identifies on average seven per 100,000 new  women with cervical cancer every year [108]. Without any screening or vaccination, the  yearly incidence rate of cervical cancer will quickly approach 50 per 100,000 [77].  Assuming 100% vaccine coverage, and lifetime efficacy, the incidence of cervical cancer  will be higher (in the case of Gardasil®, twice as high) than the rate currently achieved by  screening only if vaccinated women cease their Pap screening. Screening and vaccination  will not reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by any measurable degree [78], but will  provide reassurance to lengthen the screening interval. *Data from [108]. ‡Data from [78]. §Data from [77]. Expert commentary The HPV vaccines neutralize type-specific  HPV infections prior to engulfment into  the basal cells of the epithelium. Therefore,  the vaccines should provide benefit to any  epithelium that is at risk for HPV infec­ tion, with cervical cancer being the most  prevalent HPV-associated cancer. Other  cancers less closely associated with HPV  occur in the vagina, vulva, penis, anus and  oropharynx [7]. Results from the HPV vac­ cine trials to prevent CIN and cervical can­ cer should theoretically translate into some  level of partial protection from these other  HPV-associated cancers. Specific long-term  cancer registries or ecologic epidemiologi­ cal data will be needed to determine the  extent of impact, potentially quite small, of  the HPV vaccines on these cancers several  decades from now.  Likewise, the benefit of Gardasil for  the prevention of the noncancerous but  lethal juvenile respiratory papillomatosis,  caused at minimum by HPV-6 and -11,  will require decades of follow-up to ascer­ tain whether efficacy occurs and whether  the duration of vaccine efficacy truly pre­ vents this disease or merely prolongs the  number and frequency of surgeries with no  difference in overall survival. To prevent  this disease, the prophylactic vaccines will  have to prevent the autoinoculation from  the original field infection to prevent fur­ ther disease. The long-term impact on genital wart prevention  could prevent some nonlethal HPV infections. The disutility of  genital warts is the replacement of a normally functioning pro­ tective epithelium with warty tissue that can be both disfiguring  and highly disruptive to normal life activities. Serious doubts  about Gardasil’s long-term protection are raised by the surpris­ ingly lower efficacy in preventing genital warts of any HPV type,  and the rapid fall in antibody titers that do not respond uniformly  well to the anamnestic challenge.  Vaccination of 12–15-year-old girls has certainly been shown  by cost–effectiveness models to have the potential to reduce cer­ vical cancer incidence many decades in the future [38–43]. The  scientific evidence supporting this program is the immunobridg­ ing principle and the generally good safety profile, with only  rare debilitating neurologic adverse events reported. Despite no  efficacy data and no evidence for duration of efficacy past the  first decade, public-health bodies recommend young adolescent  female vaccination. Should the duration be less than 15 years,  cervical cancers will only be postponed at a great cost, not pre­ vented. In addition, there has been very limited public acceptance  of vaccinating 10–12-year-olds, with the greatest proportion of  vaccinees being 16–20 years of age [55,69]. But there are millions of women under 26 years of age who are  already sexually active and who may derive immediate benefit  from vaccination based on induced antibody titers that exceed  the bridging titers induced in adolescents. HPV vaccines cannot  stop the progression of HPV disease outcomes in cells already  infected with HPV, but induced antibodies should be able to  neutralize autoinfecting HPV virions from the original field infec­ tion, thereby disrupting the infectious cycle and preventing the  recurrence of CIN and anogenital cancers that currently occurs at  frequencies up to 12-times the general population rate of disease  and as long as 20 years out from the original infection [26,70–72].  In industrialized countries with organized screening, regardless  of whether you choose to vaccinate or which vaccine you choose  to use for vaccination, the most important message to relay to  women is the continued need for cervical cancer screening exams.  The vaccines do not replace Pap testing. The incidence of cervical  cancer will increase if screening is forgotten after vaccination. The  decision to vaccinate in countries with organized, well-attended  screening programs must be made by the individual herself or as  a shared decision with her provider. Furthermore, the benefits of  reducing the number of abnormal Pap screens, the number of col­ poscopies and the number of excisional treatments necessary must  Currently approved prophylactic HPV vaccines

Expert Rev. Vaccines 8(12), (2009) 1676 Review be weighed against the risks of missing screening exams, booster  needs and small but real serious side effects, including death. The  incidence of cervical cancer will not be reduced by vaccination  alone or vaccination in combination with screening (Figure 5).  In countries without well-attended, organized screening, the last­ ing effects of HPV vaccination will be completely dependent on the  duration of vaccine efficacy and the population coverage achieved,  with the potential to save hundreds of thousands of women’s lives,  balanced against the very small risk of serious adverse events. Five-year view It is highly likely that the prophylactic vaccines will be found to  be effective at preventing autoinoculation of HPV infections in  women already actively infected with HPV. These data are being  collected over longer follow-up times than the initial pivotal tri­ als. This would broaden the use of HPV vaccines to infected  women and potentially older women to help stem the secondary  outbreaks of similar anogenital cancers 10–20 years after the first  CIN 3 development.  There is already a supplemental vaccine being trialed for  Gardasil recipients that is hypothesized to provide protection  against the HPV types for which it does not currently have  cross-protection (HPV-31, -33, -45, -52 and -58). The long-term  plan is to combine the current four HPV types in Gardasil with  these supplemental five oncogenic HPV types to broaden the can­ cer protection possible for Gardasil. When Merck will ­withdraw  Gardasil for its replacement nonovalent vaccine is unknown.  Therapeutic vaccines have been slower to develop than the  prophylactic vaccines. Developing a vaccine whose primary  method of action is the cell-mediated immune response with killer  T cells actively destroying HPV-infected epithelial cells has been  technically more challenging. Several candidate vaccines are in  early trials.

Key issues •	 In countries with well-attended organized, screening programs, vaccination will not reduce cervical cancer any further than screening  has already achieved. Vaccination will reduce the number of diagnostic colposcopies and excisional therapies, thereby reducing some  associated psychosocial and reproductive morbidity, but with an attendant risk of very low-frequency serious side effects. •	 Attendance at screening programs must continue after vaccination. Without continued screening, the incidence of cervical cancer could  increase to more than double (using Gardasil® as the vaccine) the current rate within a decade. •	 In countries with little or no organized screening, if the duration of vaccine efficacy is longer than 15 years, cervical cancer can be dramatically  reduced to approximately twice the incidence established in countries with screening (from 50 to 15/100,000 women), saving hundreds  of thousands of women’s lives annually. The small risk of vaccination may be tolerable in populations where so many lives can be saved. •	 If the duration of efficacy is less than 15 years, cervical cancers will only be postponed, not prevented. •	 Both vaccines are highly effective in preventing persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+  in women who are not currently shedding active HPV virus of the vaccine-relevant types. Neither vaccine is effective in women currently  shedding active HPV virus of the vaccine-relevant types. •	 Cervarix® offers greater opportunity to reduce excisional treatments for precancerous disease, the incidence of adenocarcinoma and  squamous carcinomas over time than does Gardasil.  •	 Gardasil offers protection for men 16–26 years of age against genital warts caused by HPV-6 and -11 for 2.4 years.  •	 The emerging field of vaccine adverse event immunogenetics may be able to identify individual girls/women prior to vaccination to avoid  the rare lethal adverse events that have been reported. •	 Immunogenomics may be able to identify entire subpopulations that would suffer the most serious side effects from vaccinations,  allowing other screening methods to reduce the cervical cancer rate. •	 Cervical cancer eradication is not possible. Cervical cancer control is ongoing and robustly supplemented by vaccination.
