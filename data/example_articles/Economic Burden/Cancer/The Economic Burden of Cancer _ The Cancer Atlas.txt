As cancer treatment costs increase, prevention and early detection efforts become more cost-effective, and potentially cost-saving. Cancer results in economic burden for patients, healthcare systems, and countries due to healthcare spending, and productivity losses from morbidity and premature mortality. Economic analyses can inform resource allocation decisions and investments in cancer control programs, including prevention, early detection, treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life care. The global economic burden of cancer is unknown, although data are available in some countries. In the US in 2017, estimated cancer healthcare spending was US$161.2 billion; productivity loss from morbidity, US$30.3 billion; and premature mortality, US$150.7 billion. The economic burden of cancer in the US is approximately 1.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). In the European Union, healthcare spending was €57.3 billion, and productivity losses due to morbidity and premature death were €10.6 billion and €47.9 billion, respectively. With informal care costs of €26.1 billion, total burden rose to €141.8 billion, 1.07% of GDP. (Figure 1; for details on inflation adjustment, see Page Sources at bottom of page) Productivity losses due to premature deaths vary in transitioning countries. (Figure 2)

The economic burden of lost productivity due to morbidity and premature death from cancer is nearly 60% of the total economic burden associated with cancer in European Union countries. ACCESS CREATES PROGRESS Vaccination against human papillomavirus infection in 73 countries supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, could avert nearly US$5.6 billion in treatment costs and productivity losses between 2001–2020. Cancer treatment costs are increasing worldwide, making prevention and screening efforts more cost-effective and sometimes cost-saving. For example, when more expensive chemotherapies were considered in comparisons of colorectal cancer screening to no screening, treatment savings from preventing advanced cancer and death more than doubled in the US. Vaccination against human papillomavirus infection, which is responsible for most cervical cancers, in 73 countries supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, could avert nearly $5.6 billion in treatment costs and productivity losses between 2001–2020. Smoking is a strong risk factor for lung and other cancers. The cost of smoking globally is nearly $2.05 trillion annually, almost 2% of the world’s economic output. (Map 1; for details on inflation adjustment, see Page Sources at bottom of page) Most of this cost is productivity losses from premature death. TWEET
