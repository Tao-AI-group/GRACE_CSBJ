Abstract Background: Patients with cancer experience financial toxicity from the costs of treatment, as  well as material and psychologic stress related to this burden. A synthesized understanding of  predictors and outcomes of the financial burdens associated with cancer care is needed to underpin  strategic responses in oncology care. This study systematically reviewed risk factors and outcomes  associated with financial burdens related to cancer treatment. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched  from study inception through June 2018, and reference lists were scanned from studies of patient- level predictors and outcomes of financial burdens in US patients with cancer (aged ≥18 years).  Two reviewers conducted screening, abstraction, and quality assessment. Variables associated with  financial burdens were synthesized. When possible, pooled estimates of associations were  calculated using random-effects models. Results: A total of 74 observational studies of financial burdens in 598,751 patients with cancer  were identified, among which 49% of patients reported material or psychologic financial burdens  (95% CI, 41%−56%). Socioeconomic predictors of worse financial burdens with treatment were  lack of health insurance, lower income, unemployment, and younger age at cancer diagnosis.  Compared with patients with health insurance, those who were uninsured demonstrated twice the  odds of financial burdens (pooled odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.33–3.30). Financial burdens  were most severe early in cancer treatment, did not differ by disease site, and were associated with  Correspondence: Grace L.

worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and nearly twice the odds of cancer medication  nonadherence (pooled OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.13–2.56). Only a single study demonstrated an  association with increased mortality. Studies assessing the comparative effectiveness of  interventions to mitigate financial burdens in patients with cancer were lacking. Conclusions: Evidence showed that financial burdens are common, disproportionately  impacting younger and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients with cancer, across disease sites,  and are associated with worse treatment adherence and HRQoL. Available evidence helped  identify vulnerable patients needing oncology provider engagement and response, but evidence is  critically needed on the effectiveness of interventions designed to mitigate financial burden and  impact. Background Although the burden of cancer costs on the US healthcare system is well-recognized,1,2  more recently, the personal “financial toxicity” associated with the cost of care has also been  identified as a distinct consequence of cancer treatment.3–13 A recent systematic review that  sought to define the prevalence of the types of financial hardships among patients with  cancer showed that 40% to 50% of US patients experienced material or psychologic  stressors related to the cost of treatment.13 The frequency of financial burdens among  patients with cancer could also increase, especially for those facing escalating cancer  therapy91 costs and barriers92 to insurance coverage.2,12,14,15 As a result, cancer’s overall financial burden-including the direct costs of care, the indirect  costs (eg, lost work, income, and savings), and the distress resulting from these financial  stressors of cancer care-is now generally acknowledged as a priority concern faced by US  patients as well as the oncology providers caring for them. Yet an effective response to this  problem remains lacking, with approximately one-quarter to one-half of patients reporting  inadequate oncology provider engagement with their financial burdens.16,17 To inform  effective response and intervention in vulnerable patients,18 a comprehensive synthesis of  the risk factors for and outcomes of financial burdens is needed. We therefore conducted a  systematic review of these risk factors and outcomes across studies of US patients with  cancer to identify the types of burdens in vulnerable patient subgroups and the consequent  health impact. Methods Protocol and Registration This protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017054521). Results are reported per the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. 19 Eligibility Criteria Studies were searched that contained primary data analyses examining financial burdens  among patients with cancer and the associations of burdens with socioeconomic,  demographic, clinical, intervention, and outcome variables. Based on existing conceptual  Smith et al. Page 2 J Natl Compr Canc Netw. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 October 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript

frameworks,12,20 studies of both material and psychological financial burdens in patients  with cancer were searched. We included English-language, peer-reviewed, full-text studies  conducted in US adults (aged ≥18 years) with cancers of any disease site and stage, and in  any part of the cancer disease trajectory. Exclusion criteria were as follows: non-US studies  (given major differences in health insurance and employment among countries), no original  data analysis, and no patient-level financial burdens reported. Search, Study Selection, and Data Collection MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched from study  inception until June 2018, guided by a research librarian (Y. Geng), and reference lists of  relevant reviews were manually examined. Search terms and strategy are delineated in  eFigure 1 and eAppendix 1, available with this article at JNCCN.org. Two reviewers (G.L.  Smith, P.G. Advani) performed title and abstract screening, full-text review, and consensus  resolution of interrater discrepancies for inclusion (kappa, 0.79). Two reviewers for each  study (G.L. Smith, P.G. Advani, M.S. Ning) abstracted and cross-checked study  characteristics, including design, eligibility, and definition or measure of financial burdens  directly reported from the text. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. Financial Burden, Risk Factor, and Outcome Measures We extracted financial burden variables from each study, including measures of direct  material burdens (eg, higher out-of-pocket [OOP] costs), indirect burdens (eg, lost savings  and increased debt), and psychological burdens (eg, financial worries or distress). Key terms  were health expenditures, healthcare costs, cost of illness, financing, fees, charges,  bankruptcy, insolvency, economic hardship, economic burden, economic stress or distress,  economic difficulty, OOP costs, costs, expenses, and spending. A complete list of search  terms is included in supplemental eFigure 1. We extracted reported associations between  independent variables (eg, risk factors or interventions) and financial burden variables, and  associations between financial burden variables and outcome variables, statistical tests of  associations, and magnitude/significance of effects (odds ratios [ORs], risk ratios, hazard  ratios [HRs], and 95% CI).21 Risk of Bias Assessment Reviewers independently ascertained the risk of bias using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool  for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies (supplemental eTable 1),22 including  overall study quality (ie, individual study rated as “good” if it met all applicable quality  assessment criteria, “fair” if it met most of the criteria, and “poor” if it met a minority of the  criteria). Strength of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations  Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.21 Data Synthesis For studies reporting the frequency of financial burdens (based on the study’s specific  measure of material or psychological financial burden), the total sample-weighted  prevalence of financial burdens was calculated. Per Cochrane Consumers and  Communication Review Group guidelines,21 we performed a qualitative synthesis of  Smith et al. Page 3 J Natl Compr Canc Netw.

associations. Quantitative associations were pooled for insurance status and financial  burdens,23–27 and for financial burdens and medication adherence,5,28,29 because these  measures could be pooled across multiple studies. We converted reported ORs into log ORs  to quantify the effect, using the generic inversevariance method with a random-effects model  to pool ORs. When needed, 1/OR was used for consistency of the referent group in pooled  estimates. Adjusted estimates were used where possible for primary analyses to decrease  potential confounder bias. Extracted 95% CIs were transformed into standard errors.  Heterogeneity of the data was tested with Cochran’s Q test and interpreted using the I2  index. When I2 = 40%, heterogeneity was explored through sensitivity analyses by  eliminating outliers (RevMan 5.3.5 [Reviewer Manager, Copenhagen]).30 Results Study Selection Of 5,711 nonduplicate records screened, with 452 abstracts and/or full texts reviewed, 74  studies met the final inclusion criteria per PRISMA (Figure 1). Randomized studies were  eligible, but none in the literature met inclusion criteria. Study and Patient Characteristics Studies represented an aggregate sample of 598,751 patients with cancer (Table 1). Of  566,531 patients for whom race/ethnicity was reported, 86% were categorized as white, non- Hispanic white, or Caucasian. Of 597,575 patients for whom sex was reported, 54% were  female. Weighted mean age was 59.5 years (95% CI, 57.5–62.3). Additional study  characteristics are reported in eAppendix 1 and supplemental eTable 2. In 25 reporting  studies (of 20,272 patients), the sample-weighted prevalence was 49% (95% CI, 41%−56%)  of patients with cancer with any financial burden (Figure 2). Financial Burden Measures Financial burden measures analyzed across studies were as follows: (1) direct material  financial burdens of cancer treatment, such as higher OOP expenses, examined in 19% of the  74 studies (n=14); (2) indirect financial burdens, such as lost savings, work, and  productivity, and inadequacy of financial resources to meet needs for food, housing, and  transport as a result of cancer treatment, examined in 57% of the studies (n=42); and (3)  psychological hardships resulting from financial burdens, such as the experience of distress,  stress, hardship, and worry, examined in 14% of the studies (n=10) (Table 1). When grouped  by type of financial burden, the prevalence ranged from 39% to 64% of patients with direct,  indirect, or psychological burden, with no statistically significant difference in prevalence by  burden type (see eAppendix 1). Risk of Bias Of 74 studies with observational study designs, the primary sources of bias were recall bias  in retrospective and cross-sectional study designs and selection bias (additional details in  eAppendix 1 and supplemental eTable 1). A total of 72% of the studies had a “good” quality  assessment for risk of bias, with a clearly specified study population, participation by >50%  of eligible persons, effect estimates provided with variances, a clearly defined risk factor and  Smith et al.

outcome measures consistently measured across study participants, and adjustment for  confounders. The strength of pooled evidence ranged from very low to low (additional  details in supplemental eTable 3). Risk Factors Predicting Financial Burdens With Cancer Treatment A total of 50 studies evaluated the risk factors for financial burdens, demonstrating similar  risk factors for the different types of burdens (direct material, indirect, and psychological  burdens) (supplemental eTable 4). Evidence supported multiple socioeconomic factors as  independent risk factors. Lack of health insurance was associated with increased odds of  (more severe) financial burdens.6,11,23–25,31–46 In the pooled analysis (of 4 of 15 studies  examining insurance status),23,24,26,27 patients lacking any drug or health insurance  coverage had twice the odds of experiencing financial burdens with cancer treatment,  compared with patients who had partial/full insurance coverage (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.33– 3.30) (Figure 3). A limited number of studies evaluated the association by specific insurance  type, showing that Medicare,35,38 supplemental,6,43 and commercial insurance44 coverage  were associated with decreased financial burdens compared with patients lacking insurance  coverage and those with Medicaid. Lower income was associated with increased odds of financial burdens, 6,11,23,24,26,27,31–33,35–37,40–42,47–58 with a dose-response relationship across the income  spectrum in a limited number of studies.23,52,53 Evidence also indicated that unemployment  or job change11,24,31,32,36,37,49,51–53,57–65 and lower education were independent risk factors  for worse financial burdens,23,35,40–42,48,51,61,66 although in 2 studies, education was not a  risk factor.26,67 Demographic risk factors for financial burdens included younger age, which was associated  with worse financial burdens across the studies. 11,14,24,25,27,31,32,38,40–42,46,48–50,53–55,57,58,61–63,65,68–72 Evidence supported a dose- response relationship across the age spectrum.11,31,35,42,49 For example, the adjusted  probability of “material hardship” decreased from 34% for patients aged 18 to 54 years to  23% for those aged 55 to 64 years, 18% for those aged 65 to 74 years, and 10% for those  aged >75 years.11 Guy et al53 reported a contrasting finding of worse financial burdens in  patients aged 50 to 64 versus those aged 18 to 39 years, but this contrasting finding may  have been explained by financial burdens measured as OOP expenses as a percentage of  family income instead of absolute OOP alone.11 Non-white race and Hispanic ethnicity11,68  were associated with increased financial burdens compared with white race and non- Hispanic ethnicity, but the effect sizes of associations varied and race/ethnicity categories  were heterogeneous across the studies (eg, ORs ranged from 1.41 to 8.0). 11,14,24,25,27,31,32,35,37,41,52,68,71,73,74 Female versus male sex was associated with increased  financial burdens in a limited number of studies.11,14,25,35,54,58,71 Clinical risk factors for financial burdens, including disease and treatment factors, were  investigated in multiple studies. Evidence indicated that no single cancer site, histology, or  stage at diagnosis emerged as a consistent, independent risk factor for financial burdens  across the studies. In a limited number of studies, treatment with chemotherapy was  associated with increased risk of financial burdens,6,36,37,46,49,60,68 whereas receipt of  Smith et al.

radiation35,75 or oncologic surgery were not consistent risk factors. In a limited number of  studies, greater treatment duration and intensity were associated with increased financial  burdens,45,47,52,60 as were cancer recurrence or multiple cancer diagnoses.24,37,68 Non- cancer comorbidity and worse overall health and functional status were also factors  associated with increased financial burdens in a limited number of studies.6,23,36,63 Evidence across the studies supported a trajectory of financial burdens, with a greater  magnitude (effect size) of burdens at cancer diagnosis/active treatment compared with the  magnitude of burdens measured after treatment completion. Financial burdens decreased  months to years after cancer treatment was completed.11,24,25,37,55,57,64,68 The severity of all  types of burdens improved over time, including direct,57,64 indirect, and psychological.11,76  (supplemental eTable 4). In a limited number of studies on the long-term trajectory of financial burdens, evidence  indicated that certain financial burdens persisted years beyond initial treatment. Ell et al76  reported that 49% of patients had financial stress at least 12 months after diagnosis, and  Jagsi et al37 reported that 33% had persistent financial decline at 4 years after diagnosis.37  Huntington et al50 reported that a longer time from cancer diagnosis was associated with  increased financial burdens in patients with chronic multiple myeloma undergoing long-term  treatment. A single study implemented a financial navigation intervention. Among patients  enrolled in the program, material financial burdens remained unchanged but psychological  financial burdens decreased over time. However, this was a single-arm intervention without a  “usual-care” group for statistical comparison.77 Health Outcomes Associated With Financial Burdens The association of financial burdens with health behaviors was addressed in 23 studies, and  with quality of life and survival in another 23 studies (supplemental eTable 5). Financial  burdens, including direct, indirect, and psychological burdens, all demonstrated associations  with medical nonadherence (ie, delaying, foregoing, or not completing necessary medical  care) to cancer-specific treatment and general medical care. Cancer-specific treatment nonadherence was associated with financial burdens, 5,26,28,29,44,70,75,78,79 with 2% to 10% of patients with higher financial burdens reporting  nonadherence to chemotherapy and oncology appointments28,33,80 and 17% to 30%  reporting nonadherence to oral maintenance cancer therapies, such as imatinib for chronic  myeloid leukemia and endocrine therapy for breast cancer.5,50,70 In the pooled analysis,  patients with higher financial burdens (defined as having greater financial distress,  copayments, or direct prescription costs) had nearly twice greater odds of cancer medication  nonadherence (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.13–2.56) (Figure 4; sensitivity analyses in eAppendix  1). Higher financial burdens were also associated with general medical nonadherence in a  limited number of studies, including higher frequency of omitted or delayed subsequent  cancer screening in patients with cancer and survivors; forgoing or delaying cancer  survivorship care and follow-up, dental care, ophthalmologic care, prescription medications,  and mental and primary medical care28,36,37,53,68,81,82; and lower health self-efficacy and  treatment decision-making.58 Smith et al.

Financial burdens, specifically indirect burdens and psychological burdens, were associated  with decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) dimensions across the studies  (supplemental eTable 5), with more than twice the odds of worse overall physical, mental,  emotional, and social function and well-being and increased anxiety, depression, and worry.  A dose-response relationship was present, with more severe financial burdens associated  with incrementally worse HRQoL scores when measured on continuous scales. 25,35,47,76,83,84 In a single study of 231,596 patients with cancer, financial burden measured by bankruptcy  was independently associated with increased mortality, with nearly twice the mortality risk  compared with those not experiencing bankruptcy (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.64–1.96).71 No  other study in our review investigated the association of other financial burden measures  with mortality. Discussion This systematic review of 74 studies identifying financial burdens associated with cancer  treatment in >500,000 US patients highlights the ongoing critical need to mitigate this  problem. The 49% frequency of financial burdens associated with cancer treatment reported  in this review, derived across a variety of oncology settings, rivaled the burdens from  common clinical toxicities associated with cancer treatment-for example, up to 28%  incidence of cardiotoxicity and 34% to 51% incidence of peripheral neuropathy attributed to  cancer therapies reported in prior studies.85–87 Our findings build upon one prior review that  identified a 40% to 50% prevalence estimate of financial hardships from cancer treatment in  US patients13 and a 28% to 73% prevalence estimate in another review of patients  internationally,88 validating prior estimates and including contemporary studies. Our study  demonstrated that multiple types of burdens-direct material, indirect, and psychological  burdens-were uniformly prevalent. This finding underscores the need to assess  multidimensional financial burdens in vulnerable patients early in treatment and  survivorship, as well as the need for multidimensional interventions to effectively mitigate  burdens. Across the studies, socioeconomic risk factors for direct, indirect, and psychological  financial burdens were a lack of health insurance, lower income, and unemployment.  Working-aged patients aged <65 years and patients without insurance or with Medicaid  coverage (compared with private or Medicare coverage) had excess financial burdens.  Multiple studies showed excess financial burdens among women (although the strengths of  statistical significance in the P values in the studies approached the threshold of .05) and  patients of nonwhite race and Hispanic ethnicity (although with a varying range of effect  sizes in studies). These data identify the disproportionate risk of cancer’s financial burdens  in vulnerable patient groups and further trigger the hypothesis of whether financial burdens  could be a direct and potentially targetable mediator of adherence and mortality disparities  in US patients with cancer. Across the studies, the clinical risk factors of initial active  treatment, higher treatment intensity, and chemotherapy indicated more severe financial  burdens. Evidence did not support the notion that financial burdens differed across cancer  disease sites, stages, or histologies, highlighting relevance across patient populations. Smith et al.

The dearth of studies identifying effective interventions reveals a current evidence gap and  demonstrates a clinical need for comparative effectiveness studies of interventions to better  equip oncology care teams to respond to patients’ financial burdens and health impact. Our  study’s examination of health outcomes demonstrated that direct material, indirect, and  psychological financial burdens adversely impacted cancer treatment adherence, including  long-term maintenance therapy, and indirect and psychological burdens adversely impacted  HRQoL. Additional study is needed on the impact of different types of financial burdens on  cancer mortality, given the single study providing evidence of an association between  bankruptcy and all-cause mortality. Our review provides novel insight into the documented gap between patient-reported needs  and current oncology practice, wherein oncology provider engagement is not matched with  patient-reported financial burdens. In a survey of oncology providers from the iCan Care  study, only 34% regularly had a member of their practice discuss financial burdens with  patients.16 Of the patients surveyed who desired provider engagement, only 27% reported  that engagement was adequate. Results from our review show that all types of financial  burdens and the consequent treatment nonadherence and HRQoL declines could be  meaningful targets for direct provider engagement and intervention. Bridging the observed  gaps in care would require generalizable interventions implemented across a variety of  oncology delivery settings and platforms, including early access to financial counseling,77  healthcare and prescription cost assistance programs, enhanced provider cost  communication, and patient decision tools. Limitations of this review reflect those of observational studies. First, causality of  associations was not definitively established due to potential attribution or recall bias in  retrospective and cross-sectional studies, especially those with solely subjective financial  burden measures such a psychological burden. Countering this weakness was the  consistency of risk factor and adherence associations with objectively validated measures,  such as direct material financial burden measures (eg, OOP expenses). The potential risks of  recall, misclassification, and selection and attrition bias of the included studies are further  detailed in eAppendix 1. Regarding review-level limitations, because authors may be more likely to publish studies  and selectively report outcomes that show statistical significance, the findings may  overestimate the occurrence of financial burdens or may not reflect other risk factors and  outcomes of financial burdens that may be observed in other populations, such as non-US  patients. Pooled analyses were limited, since no current standard measure of financial  burden has been established, there were only a limited number of studies whose definitions  of financial burden could be quantitatively pooled. Our results provide a visual  representation of the sign of effect, but the pooled magnitude of association should be  interpreted with caution, recognizing the limitations of meta-analysis from observational  studies and the pooling of ORs from different types of populations.89,90 The very low to low  strength of evidence implied uncertainty about the estimates, and further research could have  an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effects.

Conclusions Observational evidence supports the findings that cancer treatment’s financial burdens are  common-experienced in up to half of patients with cancer across disease sites-but that the  risks disproportionately affect socioeconomically disadvantaged and working-aged patients.  Evidence further shows that financial burdens are associated with worse treatment adherence  and HRQoL. Results from a single study also suggest that financial burdens are associated  with worse mortality. Synthesized results provide a basis for identifying patients at risk for  financial toxicity who would benefit from oncology provider and care team engagement.  However, due to the paucity of evidence identifying effective measures to mitigate financial  burdens in patients, our results highlight a critical need for ongoing efforts to develop  interventions to equip oncology care teams to respond to the meaningful adverse impact of  financial burdens in patients with cancer.
