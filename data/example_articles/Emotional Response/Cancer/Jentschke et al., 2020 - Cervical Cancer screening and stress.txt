Methods  We designed a survey to address the question of psychological burden due to abnormal Pap smear results and/or  positive HPV tests. In this online campaign approach, we aimed to reach > 2000 women all over Germany irrespective of  kind and number of abnormal screening findings. We asked for different kinds of anxiety, distress and uncertainty regarding  both, Pap and HPV status. Results  A total of 3753 women completed the survey at least partially, and almost 2300 fully completed the survey. Of these,  more than 50% were affected already since more than 1 year, and almost half of them had experienced at least three Pap  smears in follow-up examinations. Almost 70% of the women were afraid of developing cancer. Intriguingly, almost half of  the women with abnormal findings were not aware of their stage of the Pap smear. Furthermore, almost 30% of the women  displayed signs of a post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusion  Abnormal results in cervical cancer screening have an impact on patients’ psychology, irrespective of the knowl- edge and severity of the findings. Better information concerning risks and benefits of cervical cancer screening and about  the meaning of the outcome of its procedures are required to decrease this anxiety. Keywords  Psychological distress · Cervical cancer screening · Pap smear · HPV test Introduction Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women  worldwide, with more than 500,000 new cases and > 260,000  deaths reported annually [1]. In developed countries, the  established screening routines with Pap and/or HPV testing  have led to a drastic decrease of incidence and mortality of  cervical cancer over the last 5 decades. On the other hand, both, Pap smear and HPV testing,  have relatively low specificity [2–4] leading to a high rate of  women with abnormal Pap smear findings or positive HPV  results without needing treatment. In Germany, Pap smear is  still commonly used and, many women receive notification  of abnormal Pap smear results [5]. Cervical cancer is caused  by infection with high-risk HPV, and it develops very slowly  via so-called cervical intraepithelial lesions. HPV is one of  the most common sexually transmitted infections [6]. The  fact that vaccination against infection with the most com- mon types of cancer-causing HPV is available has increased  the awareness of HPV infection. However, many women are  still not aware of the connection between HPV infection and  abnormal Pap smear results [7, 8]. Notification of an abnormal Pap smear finding psycho- logically impacts women, and previous research has aimed  at assessing women’s health-related quality of life after such  a notification [9–11]. These studies have highlighted that  Electronic supplementary material  The online version of this  article (https​://doi.org/10.1007/s0040​4-020-05661​-9) contains  supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.  *	 M.

The awareness of the infectious nature of HPV may  even increase these emotions [11]. Only a few patients with abnormal Pap smear findings or  HPV results are at risk to develop cancer. Most cervical lesions  heal spontaneously within 2 years. Furthermore, HPV infec- tions are mostly transient; they clear in about 90% of all cases  without even developing a lesion. And in cases of prevalent  lesions, neither the Pap smear nor the HPV test is able to dis- tinguish between those lesions which will progress to cancer  and those which will heal spontaneously. As a consequence, Pap smear and/or HPV testing results  in a very high number of women having abnormal screening  results, and they will have to undergo follow-up testing and/ or additional examination such as colposcopy and biopsies of  the affected region until the abnormal finding disappears or a  decision for surgery (i.e., conization) is made. This sequence  of follow-up Pap smears and corresponding examinations such  as colposcopies and even biopsies create a burden to women as  they will have to stand the ongoing uncertainty whether cancer  is already in progress or not. Several studies are known which collected data from  women having abnormal Pap smear findings [15–19] or abnor- mal findings during screening routine in general [20, 21]. In  these studies, study population was rather small, with two  exceptions: (1) the TOMBOLA trial comprises 3331 women  [18] and (2) Balasubramani and colleagues collected data from  1752 women, but limited to women who underwent colpos- copy [22]. We hypothesized that the discussions in recent years regard- ing HPV infection and its possible prevention through vaccina- tion as well as debates regarding new guidelines for cervical  cancer screening would raise the awareness for the psychologi- cal burden of women affected. In 2020, Germany will shift  from yearly opportunistic cytology screening to co-testing  (cytology + HPV test) in three-yearly intervals for women  35 years and older. This will lead to more positive screen- ing results as before because of the lower specificity of HPV  testing. Therefore, the problem of psychological distress after  positive screening results will be even more evident. This study was funded by oncgnostics GmbH, a com- pany that aims to commercialize DNA methylation markers.  Study design and conception were developed by employees  of oncgnostics GmbH. Materials and methods Survey design The PODCAD was designed to obtain self-reported patient  data on the real-life impact of recurrent abnormal Pap smear  findings as well as the current use of the prevention and  healthcare system in Germany. It followed a semi-structured design, combining explora- tive questions with validated elements. Participants went through a 37-item survey including  the “Impact of Event Scale-Revised”—German Version as  well as parts of the Cervical Dysplasia Distress [19, 20, 23]  questionnaires, to evaluate the psychological and emotional  burden of recurrent abnormal Pap smears. This semi-structured approach was chosen to allow for the  detection of completely independent signals. The complete  questionnaire can be found in Supplementary Data 1 and  it was assented by the ethics committee of the University  Hospital Jena. Patient outreach The PODCAD survey was conducted in two waves during  May and June 2018 in Germany and addressed participants  purely through an online campaign including channels like  display marketing (banner), Search Engine Marketing (i.e.,  google search) and by link-sharing through the prevention  and education campaign F*ck Cancer by “Myriam von M”  on facebook (@Myriam.von.M), a community which oper- ates since the beginning of 2014. The PODCAD survey- related online campaign asked, ‘Help us to better under- stand affected women, a survey on conspicuous PAP/HPV  findings.’ Results Population and Characteristics of participants A total of 3753 women completed the survey at least par- tially within 9 weeks. The survey population showed a mean  age of 31.8 years and approximately 35.3% of the partici- pants stated to plan for children/additional pregnancies. To understand the differences between pre-organized  (F*ck Cancer Community) and spontaneous participants  (from online marketing activities), an interim analysis was  conducted comparing the pattern of 902 vs. 89 datasets from  the respective groups. This interim analysis did not reveal  any significant differences except for a higher proportion  (40.6% vs. 34.8%) of women with active family planning  attitude in the Online Marketing cohort. We interpreted this  to be the main driver for the actual web research activity. In  conclusion, both cohorts can be analyzed together. The results presented below are based on approximately  2300 complete surveys which fulfilled quality criteria and  represented the target population, women with at least one  abnormal Pap smear. However, almost half (46.6%) of the  participating women indicated that they had 3–5 (32.1%) or 

701 Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics (2020) 302:699–705	 1 3 even more (14.5%) conspicuous Pap smears (Table 1). More  than half of the women (53.1%) have already been affected  for more than 1 year and claimed to be burdened by the  conspicuous Pap smear results. Although only 40.9% seemed to know their exact Pap  smear findings (Table 2), more than 2 out of 3 women  (69.3%) stated to be afraid of developing or being diagnosed  with cervical cancer, and almost half (49.4%) expressed that  they were even afraid to die of cancer (Fig. 1). Finally, it is  worth to note that the knowledge about the Pap smear results  seems to be largely independent of the level of education/ degree. Questionnaire outcome Concerns about abnormal Pap smear findings/positive HPV  test results In consideration of the ongoing and unclear situation of con- spicuous results, more than two-third of the women with  abnormal Pap smear findings (69.9%) and more than ¾ of the  participating women with positive HPV test result (76.4%)  expressed to be at least “rather concerned” (Scores 3, 4 and  5 on a 5-point scale—Fig. 2) about the findings, respectively.  26.7% (PAP) and 30.7% (HPV) reported to be even “severely  concerned” (Score 5 on a 5-point scale—Fig. 2). Influence on family planning/future pregnancies In addition, women who claimed to still be planning preg- nancies show a significantly higher burden (average score  3.96 vs. 1.96—Fig. 3), irrespective of their age. Nearly half  of the participants (48.1%) stated that the risk of conizations  as well as the risk of preterm birth is important to them and  “clearly” to “severely” impacting their life (Scores 4 and 5  on a 5-point scale—Fig. 4, supplemental data). In one of  the four participants (25%) this has already influenced the  family planning. In conclusion, more than half of the participants (53.1%)  have to deal/cope with the described situation and conspicu- ous Pap/HPV findings for more than 1 year. Post‑traumatic stress For 28% of the women who completed the “Impact of Event  Scale-Revised” scale (n = 794) that allows for assessing their  post-traumatic stress disorder, results above the cut-off value  in the sense of a post-traumatic stress disorder were achieved  (Fig. 5, supplemental data). Seeking clarification Women suffering from positive Pap- or HPV test results are  clearly seeking clarification. If there would be a test which  Table 1   Number of suspicious  cytology test results Suspicious cytology test  results 1× 32.7% 2× 17.3% 3–5 times 32.1% more than 5 times 14.5% I’m not quite sure 3.4% Table 2   Distribution of different  cytology findings among  women who knew the actual  cytology result (40.9% of all  participants) Knowing the Pap result?

Of these, more than half (56.6%) are will- ing to pay themselves for a clarification test, 35.9% are pos- sibly willing to pay. Women still in family planning phase  would pay more than women not planning further pregnan- cies (Fig. 6, supplemental data). Discussion In this study, we investigated the experience of women  with abnormal Pap smear findings and positive HPV test  results using a semi-structured design. With more than  3700 participants, of whom almost 2300 filled the question- naire completely, this study, to our knowledge, is one of the  largest within this field. Among women with at least one  abnormal Pap smear finding the degree of completeness of  the questionnaire increased with the number of Pap smears  the women had experienced. Overall, almost half of those  women had experienced more than three, and each seventh  woman even more than five abnormal Pap smears. This  means that watchful waiting strategies that last for longer  times are followed frequently. Intriguingly, many women (40%) did not know their exact  Pap smear finding, indicating that more exact information  is required when the woman gets informed by the practi- tioner/gynecologist. Often, women only know that their  Pap is abnormal but they cannot distinguish between small  abnormalities and high-grade dysplasia. Therefore, it seems  to be necessary that the meaning of the abnormal Pap smear  finding is well explained. In this context, it may be prob- lematic that this information is usually given by the affected  women via letter sometimes together with an appointment  for the next control smear. The same holds true for the diag- nosis of a high-risk HPV infection. If HPV alone is tested  and diagnosed, the average chance to clear the infection is  around 90%. So, also in cases of HPV infections, women  need clear information what this infection means for them.  These findings are in line with a very detailed review from  Frederiksen and colleagues [24]. They summarized the data  from 16 different studies measuring psychological outcome  in women with a histological diagnosis or treatment of cer- vical intraepithelial neoplasia or even cervical cancer. One  of the key findings was that the psychological outcome of  women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was similar to  those of women with abnormal cytology but not necessarily  needing treatment. They interpreted this finding as a conse- quence of the uncertainty of the women about their true dis- ease status. Would the women be better informed, we would  not expect that such a high proportion of them, almost 70%  in our survey outcome, would be afraid to develop cancer.  Frederiksen et al. also saw that women considered a cervi- cal intraepithelial neoplasia diagnosis to be as bad as that of  cervical cancer. Even more intriguing is the fact that 50%  of the women with abnormal Pap smear finding or positive  HPV test result are afraid to die of cancer. With better infor- mation, they would be aware of the fact that “only” every  third woman diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer dies  of the disease, and that, if the disease is diagnosed early, the  chance for a complete cure is very high. Women who receive information about a suspicious  screening result often try and look for further information  in the internet. There they are often misleaded by false  information and reports from women affected with cervical  cancer. In Germany, an organized screening program started in  2020 and the responsible working groups have considered  the psychological burden which can occur after screening  results partially in their procedures. The information let- ter, which is sent to every woman 20 years and older every  5 years, gives information about the meaning of the finding  “cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1, 2, 3” and “suspicious  Pap” and the women are also informed about the fact that if  attending the screening program regularly, the chance for a  false-positive results once a year is very high [25]. 4.30% 2.00% 24.60% 20.70% 24.80% 25.20% 18.40% 20.50% 26.70% 30.70% 1.20% 0.90% 0.00% 10.00% 20.00% 30.00% 40.00% 50.00% 60.00% 70.00% 80.00% 90.00% 100.00% Pap test HPV test not concerned slightly concorned rather concerned clearly concerned severely concerned not speciﬁed Anxiety about the abnormal screening ﬁndings Fig. 2   Anxiety about the abnormal screening findings. Women with  abnormal Pap smear findings or positive HPV test results were asked  to judge, on a scale from 0 to 5 (1 = not concerned; 2 = slightly con- cerned; 3 = rather concerned; 4 = clearly concerned; 5 = severely con- cerned), how much they were concerned about these findings

703 Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics (2020) 302:699–705	 1 3 Most cervical lesions, depending upon their severity, heal  within 1–2 years, a well-known fact that justifies the watch- ful waiting strategies followed by the gynecologists which  then leads to the current situation reflected in the results of  our study. Besides better information, improved diagnostic  testing options which allow a better assessment of abnormal  Pap smears and positive HPV tests would be very helpful.  These would, on the one hand, reduce anxiety if they had  very good specificity. Frederiksen and colleagues drew the  same conclusion, that avoiding false-positive results would  substantially decrease screening-induced anxiety [24]. And  it would allow for timely treatment of relevant disease, which  then results in a very high chance for successful treatment. Our questionnaire comprised, besides explorative ques- tions, also validated elements. One of these, the Cervical  Dysplasia Distress Questionnaire [19] aims at measuring  the women’s perception of diagnostic procedures, their  distress and sexual concerns concerning a precancerous  genital lesion [20]. The other element, the “Impact of Event  Scale-Revised”, allows to estimate if some of the women  experience signs of post-traumatic stress disorder which  is known to significantly reduce quality of life and influ- ence morbidity and mortality [26, 27]. This was the case  for almost 30% of those almost 800 women who filled this  part of the questionnaire completely and properly. This is  in line with former findings [22, 28–30], where the severity  of screening-induced anxiety was also comparable to those  after traumatic events. Women do not seem to be aware of the fact that most  HPV infections are transient and that even most high-grade  cervical lesions do not progress to cancer. This is reflected  by the observation in our study that more than half of the  women with a positive HPV test result are “clearly con- cerned” about this finding. The observation that women are  even more concerned about positive HPV results compared  to suspicious Pap test findings is in contrast to a study from  Kitchener and colleagues [31], in which they could not see  an impact on distress by receiving a positive HPV test result  in addition to a positive Pap test compared to a positive Pap  test alone. However, the structure of their questionnaire was  a bit different and, e.g., HPV test alone was not addressed. Limitations of the PODCAD survey include the par- ticipant selection bias and whether this is a representative  sample of conspicuous Pap/HPV patients, as the survey was  only accessible to those with internet access. Also, because  this survey invited all individuals with conspicuous Pap/ HPV findings to take part, those with the higher burden are  more likely to have responded compared with those whose  overall scoring was lower. Additionally, a bias may have  been introduced when recalling past information such as Pap  smear scorings received and impact on daily activities. This  is reflected by the fact that 40% of the participants did not  know their exact Pap smear result.

704 	 Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics (2020) 302:699–705 1 3 However, it should be noted that the completion rate of  the survey was above the mean compared to surveys of simi- lar length (n = 19), thus operating in the range of chronic  pain disorders. Particularly high completion rates of surveys  are observed associated with pain disorders, rare diseases  and situations of high suffering. The PODCAD survey is  the first of its kind to investigate the psychological distress  during recurrent diagnostics cycles from patients with con- spicuous Pap/HPV findings and has highlighted important  findings in relation to the unmet clinical needs of the partici- pants. Better awareness of the burden of disease and avail- able diagnostic or treatment options are needed and may  help to improve real-life patient care. Conclusion From the PODCAD survey, we conclude that in Germany,  the psychological distress during recurrent diagnostics  cycles within conspicuous Pap/HPV findings is unmet or  uncontrolled in a significant proportion of the patients. The  PODCAD survey exposed a large proportion of conspicuous  Pap/HPV “sufferers” who have apparently unmet needs for  a clear prognosis or diagnosis. The burden was often felt to  be higher in the context of family planning. The survey con- cluded with the question, if the participants would be willing  to perform an additional test to receive a clear “cancer: yes/ no” result and 98% would want to undergo additional testing.  Of these, 92.5% would even pay ≥ 50€ for such a clarifica- tion test. A positive family planning history leads to even  significantly higher willingness for additional testing.
