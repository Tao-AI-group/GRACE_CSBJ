We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using a results-based convergent design to provide the ﬁrst comprehensive overview of emotional response to testing positive for HPV (HPV+). We mapped our ﬁndings using the cognitive behavioural framework. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to 09-Nov-2019 and 33 papers were included. Random-eﬀects meta-analyses revealed that HPV+ women with abnormal or normal cytology displayed higher short-term anxiety than those with normal results (MD on State-Trait Anxiety Inventory = 7.6, 95% CI: 4.59–10.60 and MD = 6.33, CI: 1.31–11.35, respectively); there were no long-term diﬀerences. Psychological distress (general/sexual/ test-speciﬁc) was higher in HPV+ women with abnormal cytology in the short-term and long-term (SMD = 0.68, CI: 0.32–1.03 and SMD = 0.42, CI: 0.05–0.80, respectively). Testing HPV+ was also related to disgust/shame, surprise and fear about cancer. Broadly, adverse response related to eight cognitive constructs (low control, confusion, cancer-related concerns, relationship concerns, sexual concerns, uncertainty, stigma, low trust) and six behavioural constructs (relationship problems, social impact, non-disclosure of results, idiosyncratic prevention, indirect clinical interaction, changes to sexual practice). Almost exclusive use of observational and qualitative designs limited inferences of causality and conclusions regarding clinical signiﬁcance.

lesions compared with cytology-based testing alone (where cervical cells are microscopically examined for abnormalities) (Australian Government, 2017; US Preventive Services Task Force, 2018; von Karsa et al., 2015). Using HPV as the primary (ﬁrst) test in cervical screening is considered to be the gold standard in many high-income countries and means that all women who attend screening receive an HPV-positive or negative result (Cuzick et al., 2006; Kitchener et al., 2009, 2014; Rebolj et al., 2019). The Netherlands and Australia were ﬁrst to fully implement HPV primary screening in 2017 (Australian Government, 2017; Aitken et al., 2019), and several high-income countries are in the planning, piloting, or early implemen- tation stages (e.g., Sweden, Italy, UK, Norway, New Zealand) (National Screening Unit. New Zealand Gov- ernment, 2017; Rebolj et al., 2019; Wentzensen et al., 2017). Other middle-and high-income countries, which have not yet switched to HPV primary screening, use HPV testing to triage borderline or low- grade abnormal cytology (Arbyn et al., 2006). Globally tens-of-millions of women every year ﬁnd out they are HPV-positive at their routine cervical screen. Over the last few decades, the psychological impact of testing positive for HPV has attracted sub- stantial research focus with many studies assessing emotional response, e.g., anxiety, concern about result, or worry about cancer. The rationale for research in this domain has usually been orientated towards attempts to mitigate unnecessary adverse psychological consequences (i.e., improve mental health outcomes) and to maximise screening re-attendance or help-seeking (i.e., improve behavioural outcomes). Given that cervical screening is usually a population-level intervention, assuming that HPV-diagnosis leads to even small percentages of women experiencing adverse eﬀects, this trans- lates to very large numbers experiencing negative psychological and/or behavioural sequelae. Hence eﬀorts to monitor emotional response have been prioritised and commissioned through some national health bodies (Andreassen et al., 2019; Maissi et al., 2004; McBride et al., 2016). Despite research in this area however, to date, heterogeneity in local cervical screening protocols (e.g., screening tests used, order of tests) and study designs have meant that some major studies have produced mixed ﬁndings. For example, a large cross-sectional study found short-term anxiety and distress in women testing positive for HPV with abnormal cytology (Maissi et al., 2004, 2005). Qualitative research has also produced ﬁndings of anxiety, stigma, stress and concern about sexual relationships following positive HPV results (McCaﬀery et al., 2006; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007). However, a large randomised controlled trial which considered diﬀerences in anxiety and dis- tress between women who were told their HPV-positive result vs. not told their result as part of routine screening practice found no overall diﬀerences (Kitchener et al., 2008). A qualitative study also reported indiﬀerence as a theme following HPV-positive results (O’Connor et al., 2014). In addition to mixed ﬁndings, some psychological studies have adopted methodological designs using hypothetical scenarios (Brown et al., 2007; Kwan et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2007; Waller et al., 2009; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007). Since these studies ask participants to imagine their emotional response to testing positive for HPV, they lack ecological validity. Other studies have combined women with oncogenic and non-oncogenic HPV types, e.g., including women with genital warts (Gra- ziottin & Seraﬁni, 2009), or including women receiving treatment for precancerous cervical changes (O’Connor et al., 2015, 2016). Again, this has meant that emotional response speciﬁc to testing posi- tive for HPV at routine cervical screening has been diﬃcult to isolate. Further, attempts to explain emotional response to HPV have been largely atheoretical to date. One study considered the role of illness representations and emotion in women with abnormal cervical screening results (without explicit HPV diagnosis), and found that emotion was explained by indepen- dent eﬀects of a combination of demographic, cognitive and emotional representations (Hagger & Orbell, 2006). Leventhal’s Common Sense Model (Leventhal et al., 2016) and Cognitive Behavioural Theory (Westbrook et al., 2011) have also been used by few studies to guide HPV-related interview or survey questions, reportedly proving useful frameworks (Maggino et al., 2007; Marlow et al., 2009). Speculatively drawing from theories and models of emotional adjustment, it is possible that appraisal and representations related to HPV diagnosis (e.g., sexually transmitted cause, lack of cure, perceived seriousness or control) (Folkman et al., 1986; Leventhal et al., 2016), concerns about cervical screening or treatment (Phillips et al., 2014), cultural/social norms and access to social support 396 E. MCBRIDE ET AL.

(Bandura, 1991), and coping or attachment style (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2008; Pietromonaco et al., 2013) may be important. Cognitive Behavioural Theory which underpins cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), in particular, may act as a promising theoretical framework for provisionally mapping emotional responses and their related constructs. The CBT model encompasses interacting dynamics between emotions, cognitions and behaviours, and has been applied widely across health domains to identify overarching areas of importance for speciﬁc conditions (David et al., 2018). Whilst researchers working on psychological aspects of HPV are yet to establish a cogent theoretical framework, the CBT model may help organise relevant psychological responses and isolate areas for further concentrated theor- etical developments. This is particularly relevant given that adverse emotional response to testing posi- tive for HPV is likely linked to several other (potentially interacting) cognitive and behavioural outcomes (e.g., sexual relationships, health literacy, understanding of result). Research, however, is needed to establish which theoretical constructs are most relevant. As it stands, there is a body of research on emotional response to HPV, but a lack of conclusive evi- dence which is useful for cervical screening programmes or informing theoretical advancement. Despite imminent roll-out of HPV primary screening in several countries and signiﬁcant international interest, there has been no review or synthesis of the literature on emotional response. This mixed methods systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the quantitative and quali- tative literature, guided by the research questions: how do women emotionally respond to testing posi- tive for HPV at cervical screening; and what inﬂuences emotional response to testing positive for HPV at cervical screening? Since emotions interact with, and are dependent upon, other biopsychosocial systems, the cognitive behavioural model (Westbrook et al., 2011) was also adopted to provide an over- arching theoretical framework, which mapped the systematic review ﬁndings for emotional response into related themes of cognitions and behaviours. This helped formulate a preliminary working model of emotional response to HPV, in an otherwise predominantly atheoretical domain. Method This review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Moher et al., 2009) (See Supplementary File 1). The protocol was registered on PROSPERO on 15.08.2018 (reg: CRD42018105134). Search strategy Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health and Web of Science were searched to retrieve articles between 01.01.1980 and 09.11.2019. The year coverage is representative of the earliest avail- able database record until the date the last search was performed. The search concepts (HPV, cervical cancer, screening, psychological) were agreed a priori and informed by breaking down the research questions. The search strategy was developed for Medline, then validated and adapted for the other databases by an experienced librarian. Additional papers were identiﬁed by screening reference lists of included papers and searching OpenGrey (www.opengrey.eu). See Supplementary File 2 for the full list of search terms. Design We used a results-based convergent synthesis design, where the qualitative and quantitative evi- dence was analysed and presented separately then integrated by juxtaposing the ﬁndings in a matrix table (Hong et al., 2017; Pluye & Hong, 2014). For the purposes of this review, the integration synthesis was deﬁned as reﬁning, comparing and contrasting emotion-focused themes across all studies. Analysis of quantitative data estimated the relevance and representativeness of emotional responses by providing estimates of eﬀect sizes and associations between testing HPV-positive HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 397

and emotional outcomes; and analysis of qualitative data provided in-depth explanations for emotional response. See Figure 1 for an overview of this design. Eligibility The titles, abstracts and full-text papers generated from the searches met the following inclusion criteria: 1. Adult population (18+) diagnosed with HPV in the context of cervical cancer screening. 2. At least one emotional outcome explicitly measured, explored, or emerged. 3. Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods design. 4. Article written in English, French, or German. Studies were excluded if they: 1. Employed a hypothetical scenario design. 2. Included participants who had cervical cancer or were receiving treatment for cervical lesions. 3. Primarily focused on HPV knowledge without linking to an emotional outcome. 4. Where data on HPV-positive results could not be extracted (e.g., grouped analysis combining test result groups).

Deﬁnition of emotion Currently, there is no scientiﬁc consensus on an agreed deﬁnition of emotion. Popular theories, for example Plutchik’s psycho-evolutionary theory of emotion (Plutchik, 2001), tend to be relatively con- sistent in how they describe primary emotions such as sadness, fear, happiness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust and anger. However, complex secondary and tertiary emotions, and their fusion with cognitions and physiological or behavioural cues, remain strongly debated across and within disciplines. Therefore, for the purposes of this review, we deﬁned categories of emotion, and related cognitions and behaviours, based on a combination of the American Psychological Associ- ation (APA) published deﬁnitions (www.dictionary.apa.org/emotion), validated outcomes reported in papers, and the review team’s interpretation in the coding and analysis stages. Selection process Extracted studies were included/excluded as part of a two-step screening process based on title/ abstract and full text. All titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers (EM, OT or KW). Abstracts that passed the initial screen progressed to full-text review. Each full-text paper was inde- pendently assessed by two reviewers (EM, LR, OT) and discrepancies were resolved through indepen- dent full-text assessment from a third reviewer (JW), followed by discussion until consensus was reached. Agreement between reviewers prior to consensus was good (Kappa = 0.701). In some cases, authors of identiﬁed papers were contacted to request additional information where eligibility was not clear. Data extraction Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers using customised Excel templates (EM, OT). Each reviewer’s data extractions were compared and integrated to achieve the most com- prehensive version. The information extracted across papers included: title, year published, study aims, sample size (total and by results group), population, study setting, participants (age, ethnicity, marital status and education), design, HPV and cytology results, outcome measures and analysis (where relevant), and main ﬁndings. Data synthesis and meta-analysis The data synthesis was conducted in three stages by two reviewers independently (EM, OT) with dis- agreements resolved through discussion or inclusion of a third reviewer until consensus was achieved (JW or ZR) (Thomas et al., 2004). Firstly, for quantitative studies, we assessed study designs, outcome measures and available data for inclusion in meta-analyses. We aimed to compare emotional responses in HPV-positive groups with a control group (e.g., HPV negative and/or normal cytology). Out of seventeen quantitative studies ident- iﬁed, six studies did not qualify for meta-analysis because their observational design did not include a comparison (control) group. A further three studies did not report data in a format suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis and corresponding authors were contacted in attempt to retrieve data; one author no longer had access to the data and two authors did not respond. Non-validated measures (e.g., single- item questions) were also excluded from meta-analyses. From the available data, we were able to perform three meta-analyses for the outcome ‘state-anxiety’, and two meta-analyses representing psychological distress (by analysing outcome measures of general distress, sexual distress and test- speciﬁc distress together). We split the meta-analyses by time point (result notiﬁcation ≤2 months [short-term] vs. >2 months [long-term]) and result group (HPV-positive with abnormal or normal cytology, vs. control). Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager, version 5.2 (RevMan 5, 2012). Random eﬀects models were chosen to account for heterogeneity in populations HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 399

and design. Unstandardised mean diﬀerences with 95% conﬁdence intervals were reported for anxiety as the included studies used the same outcome measure (STAI (Marteau & Bekker, 1992; Spielberger, 1983)). Standardised mean diﬀerences with 95% conﬁdence intervals were reported for psychological distress as outcome measures diﬀered between studies. Tests of homogeneity were conducted using the I2 statistic (Borenstein et al., 2009). Low heterogeneity was depicted by I2 values of <25%, moderate heterogeneity as 50% and high heterogeneity as >75% (Higgins et al., 2003). Tau-squared (τ2) was reported to indicate estimates of between-study variance. We were unable to conduct meta-analyses for other emotional outcomes due to lack of data. See Supplementary File 3 for the raw data extracted for inclusion in meta-analyses. Secondly, we synthesised all quantitative ﬁndings (including measures which could not be meta- analysed) by coding each measured outcome into themes of emotion, with related cognitive and behavioural themes also coded where relevant. Similarly for qualitative studies, the data were copied verbatim and thematic analysis was performed using descriptive and analytical coding to identify emotion themes, again with related cognitive and behavioural themes coded where relevant (Thomas & Harden, 2008). Thirdly, to integrate the ﬁndings of the two syntheses (integrated synthesis stage), we reﬁned the themes of emotion across the quantitative and qualitative studies. A conceptual matrix was then con- structed by mapping the emotion themes by study, to allow for comparisons and contrasts. Narrative overviews of the quantitative and qualitative ﬁndings for each emotion-focussed theme are pre- sented, with meta-analysis ﬁndings integrated. Cognitive behavioural framework – mapping interacting systems Following the data synthesis stage, the cognitive behavioural model was adopted to provide an over- arching and preliminary theoretical framework to map the ﬁndings into constructs of emotions, with related cognitions and behaviours (Westbrook et al., 2011). This helped address our second aim of understanding what inﬂuences emotional response to HPV. The cognitive behavioural model, which underpins cognitive behavioural therapy, was chosen because it has a strong evidence-base for explaining emotional response across psychology and health domains (Dobson, 2013; Hofmann et al., 2013). We used the model in its simplest form as a triad, to illustrate how emotions (feelings), cognitions (thoughts, beliefs, attitudes) and behaviours (actions) may interact to inﬂuence one another. In practice, this meant that alongside the primary thematic analysis phase, the qualitat- ive verbatim data and quantitative outcome measures were also coded to represent constructs of cognitions and/or behaviours. These thematic constructs where then illustratively mapped onto the triad model of the cognitive behavioural framework. Two reviewers independently coded and analysed all data (EM, OT), with disagreements resolved through discussion or inclusion of a third reviewer until consensus was achieved (JW or ZR) Quality assessment (risk of bias) The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool v2018 (MMAT) is a critical appraisal tool that has been specially developed for performing quality assessments in mixed method systematic reviews, and was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies and potential for bias (Hong et al., 2018). The MMAT has independent sets of quality criteria to guide judgements for qualitative studies, randomised controlled studies, non-randomised studies, observational descriptive studies and mixed-methods studies. The quality score for each reviewed study was based on criteria speciﬁc to the study design, which included ﬁve methodological domains and was calculated as an overall percentage. Mixed-methods studies were assessed using the mixed-methods criteria as well as the separate quantitative and qualitative criteria; their quality score could not exceed the weakest component. We intended for the MMAT to be used for illustrative and descriptive purposes and did not weight ﬁndings based on quality score alone. Rather, each study was assessed 400 E. MCBRIDE ET AL.

independently on its merits, limitations and overall design in the cervical screening context by two reviewers (EM, LR, OT), with discrepancies discussed and resolved with a third reviewer (JW). Rigour Rigour was maintained by using a comprehensive search strategy along with documentation of eligi- bility decisions, which ensured descriptive validity (accuracy of data) (Sandelowski et al., 2006). Interpre- tive validity was achieved through use of at least two independent reviewers (EM, OT, LR) in the data extraction phase to create a comprehensive database and perform of quality assessments (Thomas & Harden, 2008). Following each stage of the data synthesis, two reviewers (EM, OT) plus a third reviewer (JW, ZR) discussed the thematic ﬁndings and resolved disagreements to help maintain theoretical val- idity (reliability of data interpretation) (Sandelowski et al., 2006). Pragmatic validity (eﬃcacy and trans- ferability of ﬁndings) was improved by inclusion of study characteristic tables providing the context around the studies, allowing readers to judge the usefulness of ﬁndings (Thomas & Harden, 2008). Results Search results The database searches yielded 15,792 papers, with 9,343 titles and abstracts screened after removal of duplicates.

Study characteristics Seventeen papers were quantitative studies (Alay et al., 2019; Andreassen et al., 2019; Ferenidou et al., 2012; Garces-Palacio et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2018; Kitchener et al., 2008; Kwan et al., 2011; Maggino et al., 2007; Maissi et al., 2004, 2005; McBride et al., 2020; McCaﬀery et al., 2004; Nagele et al., 2019; Ngu et al., 2018; Rodriguez et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011), 15 were qualitative (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; Barreto et al., 2016; Bertram & Magnussen, 2008; Head et al., 2017; Kosenko et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2011; Linde et al., 2019; McCaﬀery & Irwig, 2005; McCaﬀery et al., 2006; McCurdy et al., 2011; O’Connor et al., 2014; Perrin et al., 2006; Tiro et al. (2019); Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007; Wyndham-West et al., 2018) and one was mixed-methods (Daley et al., 2010). A total of 12,789 women aged between 18 and 65 participated in twenty studies (n=12,244 quantitat- ive; n=545 qualitative), of whom 4,305 were reported as having tested positive for HPV (n=3,874 quan- titative; n=431 qualitative). Seven studies were conducted in the UK, seven in the USA, six in China, two in Colombia and the remaining eleven in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Tanzania and Turkey. Twenty-one studies reported level of participant education: six used samples predominately educated to tertiary-level or above, and four primary-level or below. Fourteen studies reported a predominantly white ethnicity sample, and others predominantly African and Asian. Nearly all studies recruited women through clinical settings (e.g., hospitals, primary care), except two which used public advertisements and social media. Most studies ascertained diagnosis of HPV using clinical records; however, some relied on participant self-report. Time between participants receiving their HPV result and recruitment was not reported in the majority of studies (especially qualitative); but in those which did, the time from diagnosis ranged from shortly after receiving result (notiﬁca- tion-2 months) to 2 years after result, with two outliers reporting 4.8 and 5 years. There were also vari- ations in the combinations of HPV-positive and cytology result groups between studies: most used HPV-positive with abnormal cytology (any grade or mixed) and some used HPV with normal cytology, HPV with atypical squamous cells of undetermined signiﬁcance, or HPV alone (no cytology test). Observational (cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, or cohort) designs were used in most quanti- tative studies (thirteen out of seventeen). Four quantitative studies used a randomised controlled design (Garces-Palacio et al., 2019; Kitchener et al., 2008; Maggino et al., 2007; Ngu et al., 2018), but only one directly tested and reported diﬀerences in emotion between result groups (Kitchener et al., 2008). The same RCT study also included additional analyses on the observational ﬁndings from women in the study arm where participants were informed about their HPV results. All quantitative studies included at least one outcome with a core emotional component and most used widely-tested, validated scales; though some used single-item or non-validated scales and the mixed-methods study measured emotion descriptively. The most common outcomes measured were state-anxiety, sexual distress, test- speciﬁc distress, general distress, depression, fear and shame/disgust. Fourteen of the qualitative studies conducted interviews and one conducted focus groups (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015). All qualitative studies described at least one emotional theme, mainly related to anxiety, test-speciﬁc distress, sexual distress, surprise and confusion, fear, shame and disgust, sadness, relief and indiﬀerence. Summaries presenting descriptive overviews of the studies and quality appraisal scores are pre- sented in Tables 1 and 2. Quality assessment Overall, MMAT quality scores ranged from 40% to 100%. Qualitative studies scored highest for quality (median=100%, range 40–100%), followed by quantitative studies (median=60%, range 40–100%), and the mixed methods study (40%). The main reasons for quality deductions in the quantitative studies were non-complete reporting of data and not using appropriate measures; and in qualitative 402 E. MCBRIDE ET AL.

studies, not suﬃciently substantiating result interpretation with data. See Supplementary File 4 for a breakdown of the quality scores by study and design. Emotional response We identiﬁed eight main themes of emotion which were measured or had emerged in women testing positive for HPV: anxiety; psychological distress (three types: sexual, test-speciﬁc and general); fear; surprise; shame and disgust; sadness; positive aﬀect; and apathy. Each of these emotions are discussed separately with an overview of the synthesised evidence. See Table 3 for a brief deﬁnition these emotions. The main ﬁndings from the primary mixed methods study (Daley et al., 2010) were integrated with the relevant quantitative and qualitative components throughout. Tables 4 and 5 provide an overview of the main results for the quantitative and qualitative studies, respectively. Supplementary File 5 provides the integration matrix of the themes measured or emerged across all studies. Anxiety Quantitative (anxiety) Ten quantitative studies measured anxiety at diﬀerent time points (Alay et al., 2019; Garces-Palacio et al., 2019; Kitchener et al., 2008; Kwan et al., 2011; Maggino et al., 2007; Maissi et al., 2004, 2005; McBride et al., 2020; McCaﬀery et al., 2004; Ngu et al., 2018) mostly using the state subscale from the state-trait anxiety inventory (Marteau & Bekker, 1992; Spielberger, 1983). We were able to perform meta-analyses including seven out of eleven studies, comparing HPV- positive with abnormal cytology groups vs. control groups (normal or negative results) for both short-term anxiety (result notiﬁcation ≤2 months) and long-term anxiety (>2 months). Results revealed higher short-term anxiety for women who were HPV-positive with abnormal cytology com- pared to the control groups across six studies (mean diﬀerence [MD] in STAI of 7.6, 95% CI: 4.59 - 10.60, p < .001, τ2=11.11, I2=85%); however no diﬀerences were observed for long-term anxiety across four studies (MD = 0.03 95% CI: −1.45–1.51, p = 0.96, τ2 = 0, I2 = 0%). A small meta-analysis of three studies also compared HPV-positive with normal cytology groups vs. controls, which revealed higher short-term anxiety for HPV-positive with normal cytology (MD = 6.33, 95% CI: Table 3. Brief deﬁnition of each of the emotions identiﬁed as themes. Brief deﬁnition Anxiety State anxiety describes an emotional state often characterised by apprehension, nervousness and/or uncertainty related to speciﬁc or future event(s) (Spielberger, 1983). Distress Psychological distress is a term to describe a collection of negative emotions or type of stress that results from being overwhelmed by demands or perceived threats. Distress can impact on everyday functioning related to general or speciﬁc events (APA, 2019b) Fear Fear is an intense basic emotion induced by perceived danger or threat(s) (APA, 2019c). Disgust and shame Disgust is characterised by strong aversion to something deemed unpleasant. Shame can stem from disgust and is characterised by a highly unpleasant feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the belief (or perception that others believe) that one has been dishonourable, immodest, or indecorous (APA, 2019f) Surprise Surprise is described as feelings of sudden unexpectedness. It results from violations of an expectation or detection of novelty in the environment (APA, 2019g), often followed by confusion. Sadness Sadness and depressive mood are usually temporary emotional states usually aroused by the loss of something that is highly valued (APA, 2019e). Clinical depression shares core characteristics with sadness but diﬀers in that it is a serious longer-term mental illness which signiﬁcantly impairs everyday functioning. Positive aﬀect Positive aﬀect is a broad and generic term for the internal feeling that occurs when a goal has been achieved, a source of a threat has been avoided, or one is satisﬁed with their current situation (APA, 2019d). Apathy Apathy is a lack of motivation, or the absence or suppression of emotion, interest, or concern and presents as a state of indiﬀerence (APA, 2019a). HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 407

Four studies which measured anxiety could not be meta-analysed due to study design (e.g., no suitable control group; (Ngu et al., 2018)) or lack of published data in the necessary format for extrac- tion (Alay et al., 2019; Andreassen et al., 2019; Maggino et al., 2007). Consistent with the meta-analysis ﬁndings, two of these studies reported higher short-term anxiety in HPV-positive groups compared to controls (Alay et al., 2019; Maggino et al., 2007) but not long-term anxiety (Andreassen et al., 2019); and one study without a suitable control group found that anxiety decreased over time (Ngu et al., 2018). Interestingly, a RCT which considered diﬀerences in anxiety between HPV-positive women who were told (revealed) vs. not told (concealed) their HPV status as part of an embedded trial in routine practice, found no diﬀerences between the groups (Kitchener et al., 2008). Predictors of anxiety in HPV-positive women were also explored in one study (Maissi et al., 2004): younger age, higher perceived risk of cervical cancer and not understanding the meaning of test results predicted higher anxiety within 4-weeks of results; but no predictive relationships were found for perceived importance of HPV and perceived severity of cervical cancer.

Qualitative (anxiety) Ten qualitative studies reported anxiety as a theme following HPV-positive results (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; Bertram & Magnussen, 2008; Daley et al., 2010; Head et al., 2017; Kosenko et al., 2012; McCaﬀery & Irwig, 2005; McCaﬀery et al., 2006; O’Connor et al., 2014; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007; Wyndham-West et al., 2018). Women who were anxious often had poor understanding of their results and/or HPV, expressed uncertainty about HPV, had often received their results by letter, and reported searching for further information on the internet (Head et al., 2017; Kosenko et al., 2012; McCaﬀery & Irwig, 2005; McCaﬀery et al., 2006; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007). Two studies found that women who had discussed their results face-to-face with a healthcare professional were less anxious (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; McCaﬀery & Irwig, 2005). One study (Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007) interviewed women after two HPV test results (12-months apart) and found that anxiety was a dominant theme shortly after a ﬁrst or second HPV-positive result, but that it did not generally persist in the time between the two tests. A second HPV-positive test compared to a ﬁrst one, however, was described as being more anxiety-inducing for some women. Distress Three forms of psychological distress were identiﬁed across studies: test-speciﬁc distress, sexual dis- tress and general distress. Test-speciﬁc distress related to the psychological burden of HPV and screening test results. Sexual distress related mostly to impacts on sexual relationships, a partner, or concerns about transmission of HPV. General distress related to adverse impacts on everyday func- tioning (e.g., lack of sleep and concentration). Quantitative (distress) Sixteen quantitative studies included a measure of psychological distress: ten included test-speciﬁc distress (Ferenidou et al., 2012; Garces-Palacio et al., 2019; Kwan et al., 2011; Maissi et al., 2004, 2005; McBride et al., 2020; McCaﬀery et al., 2004; Ngu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2010, 2011), eleven sexual distress (Alay et al., 2019; Ferenidou et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2018; Kitchener et al., 2008; Kwan et al., 2011; Maggino et al., 2007; Maissi et al., 2005; McCaﬀery et al., 2004; Nagele et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2010, 2011) and six general distress (Andreassen et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2018; Kitchener et al., 2008; Maissi et al., 2004, 2005; McBride et al., 2020). Test-speciﬁc distress was consistently higher (worse) for women testing HPV-positive with any cytology result compared to normal results up to 6-months post-result (Maissi et al., 2005), but not at 12-months post-result (Garces- Palacio et al., 2019). There were mixed quantitative ﬁndings for sexual distress and general distress. Sexual distress was found to be higher (worse) for women testing HPV-positive in ﬁve studies; however one low quality study showed no eﬀect (Maggino et al., 2007), and another high quality found mixed ﬁndings depending on how they analysed their data (Kitchener et al., 2008). Another small study found lower sexual desire but no diﬀerences in overall sexual function between HPV-posi- tive groups and the control (Alay et al., 2019); and a descriptive study reported that 33.3% and 43.1% of women endorsed reduced sexual interest and reduced frequency of sexual intercourse, respect- ively (Ferenidou et al., 2012). In terms of longer-term impact, sexual distress was found to persist at 6-months in two studies (Kwan et al., 2011; Maissi et al., 2005); one study examined the trajectory of adjustment to sexual distress over a 12-month period and found that adjustment occurred from one-to-6-months after HPV diagnosis (Hsu et al., 2018). Consistently, another study found no diﬀer- ences over a 12-month period (Nagele et al., 2019). General psychological distress (Golderberg & Wil- liams, 1988) was found to be slightly higher (worse) in women testing HPV-positive with abnormal cytology 4-weeks after their result in two studies (Maissi et al., 2004; McBride et al., 2020). However, no diﬀerences were found 6-months later in a follow-up study (Maissi et al., 2005) or up to 12 or 24 months later in two other studies (Andreassen et al., 2019; Nagele et al., 2019). The Kitch- ener et al. (2008) trial again had mixed ﬁndings for general distress. Among women who were told their HPV result, being HPV-positive (vs. HPV negative) was associated with slightly higher general HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 415

distress 2-weeks after the result. However, when women who had been told they were HPV-positive were compared with HPV-positive women who had not been told their HPV test result, no diﬀerences were found. Hsu et al. (2018) found that adjustment to general distress occurred between 1-and-6- months after HPV diagnosis. We performed meta-analyses to combine the available data for test-speciﬁc distress, sexual dis- tress and general distress to represent an overall measure of psychological distress in both the short-term (result notiﬁcation ≤2 months) and long-term (>2 months). One study (Maissi et al., 2005) measured two forms of long-term distress (general and sexual); therefore, two meta-analyses were performed including each of these variables independently, to avoid bias through double- counting in the total sample. Results revealed higher short-term distress for HPV-positive with abnormal cytology compared to the control across six studies (Standardised Mean Diﬀerence [SMD] = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.32–1.03, p < .001, τ2=0.18, I2=94%). Similarly, higher long-term distress was also observed for HPV-positive with abnor- mal cytology compared to the control across six studies, irrespective of whether we included the general or sexual distress outcome in the Maissi et al. (2005) study (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.05 - 0.80, p = .03, τ2=0.19, I2=92% and SMD = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.19 - 0.80, p = .001, τ2=0.12, I2=88%, respect- ively). Long-term eﬀects appeared to be limited to test-speciﬁc and sexual distress outcomes, given that the two studies which measured general distress showed no diﬀerences (Maissi et al., 2005; McBride et al., 2020). Overall, although direction of eﬀects were relatively consistent across studies, high levels of statistical heterogeneity were identiﬁed in all the meta-analyses (I2>75%), therefore caution is advised in the interpretations. See Figure 4(a)–(c) for the meta-analysis ﬁndings for psycho- logical distress. Figure 4.

Qualitative (distress) Themes indicative of test-speciﬁc distress emerged in thirteen qualitative studies (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; Barreto et al., 2016; Bertram & Magnussen, 2008; Head et al., 2017; Kosenko et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2011; McCaﬀery & Irwig, 2005; McCaﬀery et al., 2006; McCurdy et al., 2011; O’Connor et al., 2014; Perrin et al., 2006; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007; Wyndham-West et al., 2018). Clear adverse impacts were reported, with many women describing concerns about HPV infec- tion and/or the meaning of their test results. A small number of women reported that test-speciﬁc distress inﬂuenced their behaviours through triggering what they believed to be preventive action (often idiosyncratic, e.g., avoiding sharing soap/towels, exercising, or eating fruit) (Barreto et al., 2016; Wyndham-West et al., 2018). One study reported that test-speciﬁc distress primarily arose from concerns about abnormal cytology rather than HPV infection; however, it only included six women who were HPV-positive (O’Connor et al., 2014). The other studies reported that HPV infection had notably adverse impacts independent of abnormal cytology. Sexual distress was also a theme in nine qualitative studies (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; Barreto et al., 2016; Bertram & Magnussen, 2008; Kosenko et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2011; McCaﬀery et al., 2006; McCurdy et al., 2011; Perrin et al., 2006; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007), with HPV-positive women describing a range of concerns about their sexual relationships, transmission of HPV and/or impact on their partner. Some women reported anger towards their partner and arguments due to suspected inﬁdelity, or changing their sexual behaviours (e.g., avoiding sex) as a consequence of HPV. Fear Quantitative (fear) Two studies descriptively reported that fear was a adverse reaction to HPV diagnosis, with 82.4% and 25% of women endorsing it descriptively (Ferenidou et al., 2012; Maggino et al., 2007). Similarly, the quantitative component of the mixed-methods study reported >75% endorsed fear; however, the authors categorised their deﬁnition of fear as endorsements of ‘anxious’ and ‘worried’ (Daley et al., 2010). Another study found that cervical cancer worry was higher in HPV-positive women shortly after result notiﬁcation, but diﬀerences disappeared at 6-months (Kwan et al., 2011); and one study reported that worry about developing cervical cancer decreased over time (Ngu et al., 2018). During an observational period of 12 months (baseline, 6, 12 months) there were no signiﬁcant diﬀer- ences in fear of disease progression (Nagele et al., 2019). Qualitative (fear) Fear emerged as a dominant theme in ten qualitative studies (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; Barreto et al., 2016; Bertram & Magnussen, 2008; Lin et al., 2011; Linde et al., 2019; McCurdy et al., 2011; O’Connor et al., 2014; Perrin et al., 2006; Tiro et al., 2019; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007). Women mainly described fears related to the development of cervical cancer, their future health and potential infertility. Other women were afraid about the impact of their result or cancer on their family, partner and/or friends. Disgust and shame Quantitative (disgust and shame) Six quantitative studies included measures of HPV-related shame or disgust (Daley et al., 2010; Fereni- dou et al., 2012; Rodriguez et al., 2019; Ngu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2010, 2011): two used the ‘self- image’ domain within a distress measure (Mast et al., 2009); one adapted an STD-related shame scale (Cunningham et al., 2002); and two used non-validated measures. Shame and disgust were higher in women testing positive for HPV with abnormal cytology when compared to normal cytology (Wang et al., 2010, 2011), or HPV-negative with abnormal cytology (Wang et al., 2011) within 3-months of the result. Statements relating to shame and disgust were descriptively endorsed by the majority HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 417

(>50%) in a descriptive study (Daley et al., 2010); and ‘guilt’, ‘shame’ and ‘stigmatisation’ were endorsed by 41.1%, 21.5% and 15.7% respectively in another study (Ferenidou et al., 2012). HPV-related shame did not change over time (up to 6-months post result) (Ngu et al., 2018), and one correlational study found that higher stigma was signiﬁcantly associated with utilising fewer coping strategies and report- ing less protective behaviour related to cervical cancer (Rodriguez et al., 2019). Qualitative (disgust and shame) Shame and/or disgust also emerged as themes in eleven qualitative studies (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; Barreto et al., 2016; Bertram & Magnussen, 2008; Lin et al., 2011; McCaﬀery & Irwig, 2005; McCaﬀery et al., 2006; McCurdy et al., 2011; O’Connor et al., 2014; Perrin et al., 2006; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007; Wyndham-West et al., 2018). These emotions mostly centred on concerns about disclosure of results to partner/family/friends, judgement from others and the belief that nega- tive connotations (such as sexual promiscuity) were associated with HPV, sometimes leading to reports of stigma (McCaﬀery et al., 2006; O’Connor et al., 2014; Wyndham-West et al., 2018). Some women described feeling ashamed and reported variations of feeling ‘unclean’ or ‘dirty’. Although shame and disgust appeared to be reported across diﬀerent ethnic groups, these themes seemed more dominant in studies focusing on women from non-white ethnic backgrounds. Surprise (and confusion) Quantitative and qualitative (surprise) Despite surprise and/or confusion emerging as themes in ten qualitative studies (Barreto et al., 2016; Head et al., 2017; Kosenko et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2011; Linde et al., 2019; McCaﬀery & Irwig, 2005; Perrin et al., 2006; Tiro et al., 2019; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007; Wyndham-West et al., 2018), these responses were not measured using validated scales in any of the quantitative studies. One descrip- tive study reported that 70.1% of HPV-positive women endorsed that they felt ‘shocked’ (Daley et al., 2010). In qualitative studies, women often expressed surprise as the ﬁrst emotion experienced after receiving their HPV-positive result. Many reported subsequent confusion about the meaning of HPV and how they had acquired it. Often surprise and confusion appeared to be linked with knowledge that HPV is sexually transmitted, raising questions about its source and concerns about potential inﬁdelity (linking to sexual distress). Sadness Quantitative (sadness) One quantitative study descriptively reported that 14.9% of women who tested HPV-positive had clinically relevant depression scores; however, there was no control group to indicate population norms (Ngu et al., 2018). Another low quality study found that depressive/intrusive thoughts were slightly higher in women who tested HPV-positive compared to HPV-negative (time point not reported) (Maggino et al., 2007). A descriptive study reported that 51.7% of HPV-positive women endorsed that they felt ‘depressed’ (Daley et al., 2010). Qualitative (sadness) Only two out of eleven qualitative studies reported sadness or feelings of depression, and in both they were minor themes (Barreto et al., 2016; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007). Positive aﬀect (relief, acceptance) Quantitative and qualitative (positive aﬀect) In the quantitative studies, positive emotional responses, as indicated by improved outcomes follow- ing an HPV-positive result, were rarely observed. The only exception was one study where sexual 418 E. MCBRIDE ET AL.

satisfaction was higher in HPV-positive women (Kitchener et al., 2008). ‘Relief’ was also endorsed by 27.4%, ‘encouraged’ endorsed by 35.9%, and ‘in control’ endorsed by 68% of HPV-positive women in a descriptive study (Daley et al., 2010). Ten qualitative studies reported positive emotions such as relief, increased trust and acceptance, though they were minor themes (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; Head et al., 2017; Kosenko et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2011; Linde et al., 2019; McCaﬀery & Irwig, 2005; Perrin et al., 2006; Tiro et al., 2019; Waller, McCaﬀery, et al., 2007; Wyndham-West et al., 2018). Women who reported positive emotional responses to their HPV results described receiving their test results in person by a healthcare professional, consulting with a healthcare professional after results, having a supportive partner and/or mobilising social support. Relief that the result was HPV and not cancer was a less common theme. Apathy Quantitative (apathy) One study descriptively measured apathy and found that 38% of women reported no reactive emotion to their HPV diagnosis (Maggino et al., 2007). Although the other quantitative studies did not directly measure indiﬀerence or apathy, the lack of observed diﬀerences in emotional outcomes between women receiving HPV-positive vs. negative results may be suggestive of apathetic or ambivalent responses, reported across quantitative papers under each individual emotion. Qualitative (apathy) Two qualitative studies reported indiﬀerence (O’Connor et al., 2014; Tiro et al., 2019), however this was either a minor theme or related more to the HPV testing procedures than response to testing HPV-positive. Cognitive behavioural framework – interacting systems The emotional response ﬁndings for quantitative and qualitative studies were additionally coded to identify related cognitions and behaviours, as a starting point to determine how these three factors interact. Within the eight broad emotion-focused themes, twelve cognitive constructs and ten behav- ioural constructs were identiﬁed (many of which are described in the results under each emotion). Cognitions related to emotional response Broadly, adverse emotional response to testing positive for HPV was linked to eight negative cogni- tions: low perceived control, confusion, stigma, relationship concerns, sexual concerns, cancer-related concerns, lack of trust in others and uncertainty about meaning of result or future health. Conversely, neutral or positive emotional responses were linked with high perceived control, trust in others and acceptance. Behaviours related to emotional response Related to behaviours, six areas were linked to adverse emotional response: negative impact on relationships, negative social impact, non-disclosure of results, idiosyncratic prevention, indirect clini- cal interaction (e.g., results by letter) and changes in sexual behaviour. In brief, negative impact on relationships and negative social impact referred to themes such as reports of arguments with a partner or avoiding contact with others. Non-disclosure of results represented women who expressed that they deliberately concealed their result from others. Idiosyncratic prevention referred to reports of attempts to prevent the spread of HPV through engaging in activities that are not evidence-based, such as washing toilet seats. Indirect clinical interaction referred to receiving results by methods with no personal contact such as a mailed letter and/or not seeking advice from a healthcare professional. Changes in sexual behaviour described lower sexual activity, avoiding sex and/or using a condom. HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 419

Conversely, four behavioural themes were linked with positive or neutral emotional response: direct clinical interactions; social support; behaviour of others; and future screening attendance. In brief, women who reported speaking to a healthcare professional after their HPV-positive result (direct clinical interactions) or their partner/family/friends (social support) expressed feeling more reassured, less anxious, relieved and/or more accepting. Helpful behaviours of others related to part- ners/friends/family sourcing information on HPV or encouraging help-seeking behaviours. Attend- ance at a screening appointment after receiving an HPV-positive result (future screening attendance) was described by some women as providing reassurance. According to the cognitive behavioural model, these three constructs of emotions, cognitions and behaviours are likely to directly inﬂuence and/or interact with one another. This formulates a working model of what may inﬂuence emotional response to testing positive for HPV. See Figure 5 for an over- view of emotions, cognitions and behaviours mapped on to the cognitive behavioural framework. Discussion This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of emotional response to HPV diagnosis at cervical cancer screening, as well as a provisional model for understanding how emotions may interact with cognitions and behaviours using the cognitive behavioural framework. Testing positive for HPV at cervical screening appears to be most strongly associated with short-term anxiety, short and long-term psychological distress, and related to feelings of disgust and shame, surprise and fear about cancer. There was little evidence of sadness or depression and a minority of women reported apathy or relief that they had been diagnosed with HPV rather than cancer. Anxiety was one of the most common adverse responses reported shortly after women had received their HPV-positive result across all studies. Our meta-analyses revealed higher short-term state anxiety in women testing positive for HPV with abnormal cytology or normal cytology when compared with normal screening results (mean diﬀerence on STAI (Spielberger, 1983) of 7.6 and 6.33, respectively); though high statistical heterogeneity was observed, potentially due to diﬀerences in screening contexts and magnitudes of eﬀect sizes (I2 >75%). These ﬁndings are consistent with Cognitions Emotions Behaviours Neutral or Positive Cognitions • High perceived control • Trust in others • Acceptance • Indifference Negative Cognitions • Low perceived control • Confusion • Stigma • Relationship concerns • Sexual concerns • Cancer concerns • Lack of trust in others • Uncertainty Negative Behaviours • Impact on relationships • Social impact • Non-disclosure of results • Idiosyncratic prevention • Indirect clinical interaction • Sexual behaviours Neutral or Positive Behaviours • Direct clinical interactions • Social support • Positive behaviour of others • Future screening attendance Negative Emotions • Anxiety • Distress • Fear • Disgust/shame • Surprise • Sadness Neutral or Positive Emotions • Relief • Apathy Figure 5.

another systematic review which found elevated anxiety in women with abnormal cytology who were attending for colposcopy (a more advanced stage in the screening process) (O’Connor et al., 2016). Interestingly, when comparing our results to this review, anxiety scores observed in colpo- scopy patients appeared to be descriptively similar to women testing positive for HPV with abnormal cytology (mean STAI score range: 34.0 - 49.0 pre-colposcopy vs. 39.6 - 46.0 after test result). These similarities suggest that anxiety associated with an HPV-positive screening result may be comparable to the anxiety experienced at follow-up investigative procedures (colposcopy); or may persist from the time of result to colposcopy. Reassuringly, however, the results from our meta-analysis revealed that anxiety did not appear to persist in the long-term (> 2 months after notiﬁcation), when comparing HPV-positive with abnormal cytology vs. normal/negative result groups. Also, overall, the mean anxiety scores observed across studies did not generally exceed thresholds for clinical signiﬁcance. The anxiety scores associated with a HPV-positive result tended to be higher than expected in the general population but lower than the cut-oﬀfor clinically important anxiety. Although, it is worth noting that all quantitative studies assessed anxiety across the whole study sample without conducting subgroup analyses. From a clinical perspective, it is highly unlikely that acute adverse emotional response to HPV would be expected or detectable at the population level. It is more likely that certain groups of women would be at higher risk of clinically important anxiety (e.g., low socioeconomic status, ethnic minority groups, low health literacy) who should additionally be studied or analysed separ- ately. Anxiety was a dominant theme in the qualitative literature which, due to the likelihood of self-selection bias in qualitative studies, supports the notion that certain groups of women may be prone to very high anxiety. HPV positivity was also related to psychological distress in both the short-term and long-term. Our meta-analyses (which combined sexual, test-speciﬁc and general distress) revealed higher distress in women testing HPV-positive with abnormal cytology when compared with normal/negative results, at both result notiﬁcation to 2-months and 2-months onwards. Long-term distress (> 2-months), however, seemed to be speciﬁc to sexual and test-speciﬁc distress, as the studies which measured general distress at this time point found no diﬀerences. Experiencing distress related to sexual relationships, inﬁdelity and potential transmission of the virus (sexual distress) is consistent with the broader literature on emotional response to other STIs and HPV in non-screening contexts (e.g., genital warts, other cancers) (Dodd et al., 2016; Graziottin & Seraﬁni, 2009). In this review, sexual distress appeared mostly, but not exclusively, limited to women in relationships and/or with current sexual partners in the qualitative literature, which may help explain some heterogeneity in ﬁndings. For some women, it was also reported as associated with relationship problems (e.g., arguing over suspected inﬁdelity) and changes in sexual practice (e.g., avoiding sex). Distress related to the meaning of screening test results (test-speciﬁc distress) was very common in the qualitative literature and was often described as the successor to surprise and confusion. It was mostly linked to low HPV awareness, not understanding result meaning, confusion about the aetiol- ogy of HPV and concerns about future health. As HPV cannot be cured and there are no clear (prac- tical) prevention methods available (except vaccination prior to exposure), some women reported feeling that they were not in control of their health. Low perceived control appeared related to higher test-speciﬁc distress. A small number of women also reported engaging in idiosyncratic pre- vention methods to help treat or ‘contain’ HPV, such as washing toilet seats or increasing physical activity. As a psychological formulation, these forms of prevention could be interpreted as behav- ioural attempts to gain control and reduce distress (Westbrook et al., 2011). High levels of distress about result also appeared to be closely related to fears about developing cancer which, together, intensiﬁed overall adverse emotional response. Shame and disgust emerged as themes in the qualitative studies and a small number of women also reported feeling that there was stigma attached to HPV, which is consistent with broader STI research (Bickford et al., 2007; Jeynes et al., 2009; Nack, 2000). In line with sexual distress and test- HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 421

speciﬁc distress, shame and disgust seemed to be associated with maladaptive behaviours. Some women reported reluctance to disclose their HPV result to others and/or to seek social support from their partner, family, or peers because of feeling ashamed. To further assess the relevance of shame and disgust in the cervical screening context, future quantitative research should incorporate validated measures which include relevant behavioural impacts. Relatively few studies measured sadness, depression, or generalised distress. In those studies which did, there was little evidence of adverse (clinically important) eﬀects associated with any HPV-positive result. A small number of qualitative studies reported positive or neutral emotional responses, such as relief that a test result was HPV and not cancer or indiﬀerence. However, these were not common and/or dominant responses. Across all studies (quantitative and qualitative), adverse emotional response was mainly related to not understanding the meaning of the result, being in a relationship or having a current sexual partner, non-white ethnicity, receiving test result by letter, not discussing the result with a healthcare professional, little social support and lower levels of education. Adverse emotional response was observed across all studies but appeared most prominent in the qualitative literature. Although fear and surprise/confusion were common themes in the qualitative studies, they were rarely measured in the quantitative studies, highlighting a gap in quantitative research which warrants further exploration. Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that receiving an HPV-positive result at cervical screening can cause signiﬁcant disturbance for some women, however, likely the minority of the population and/or certain groups. Methodological considerations Importantly, this systematic review raises some relevant methodological considerations. Nearly all studies adopted cross-sectional, descriptive and/or qualitative designs, prohibiting inferences of causality between testing positive for HPV and emotional response. The persistence of HPV infec- tion (and the development of abnormal cells) are closely intertwined with immunological response; and there is a body of literature which suggests that psychological or social stressors can impair immune response (Fang et al., 2008; Marsland et al., 2017; Steptoe et al., 2007). Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that HPV activation and/or persistence are functions (or sub-functions) of psychologi- cal stress (i.e., adverse emotion). Interestingly, the one large RCT study in this review which com- pared anxiety and general distress between women testing HPV-positive who were told (revealed) vs. not told (concealed) about their HPV status (Kitchener et al., 2008), found similarly elevated anxiety scores (no diﬀerences). This suggests that elevated levels of anxiety and distress may be present prior to learning HPV-positive screening results, which supports the notion that psycho- logical stress could play a role in HPV activation/persistence. Other research suggesting that anxiety associated with HPV is usually temporary and normalises at 6-month follow-up may provide evidence against this mechanism; although it is worth noting that 41% of HPV cases clear within 6 months (Bulkmans et al., 2007), meaning eﬀects may be confounded. Further research is needed to test the validity of such psychobiological mechanisms and/or other potential causative pathways. Very few studies also analysed and/or interpreted their data in terms of clinical signiﬁcance, meaning it was not possible to distinguish between normal and clinically relevant emotional responses for most outcomes. Negative response to adverse information is usually a temporary process constituting a normal part of human consciousness. Therefore, studies in this review which drew implicative conclusions based on between-group diﬀerences without further interpret- ation provided little insight distinguishable from healthy response. To progress this ﬁeld of psycho- logical research, future studies should be designed and appropriately powered to test for clinical signiﬁcance rather than between-group diﬀerences alone. Most participants were educated to secondary level or above (where it was reported) and there were relatively few studies from low-and-middle-income countries. The highest quality studies 422 E. MCBRIDE ET AL.

consisted of well-educated (tertiary level) white patients living in high-income-countries which used organised screening programmes. Consequently, the main ﬁndings of this review are weighted towards relatively homogenous samples and may not be directly translatable to other settings or lower-income-countries. The qualitative studies which were conducted in low-and-middle-income- countries (Brazil, Colombia, Taiwan, Tanzania) reported stronger adverse emotional impacts (Barrera-Clavijo et al., 2015; Barreto et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2011; Linde et al., 2019). Therefore, the ﬁndings reported in this review may be conservative compared to other health systems or cultural contexts. Finally, HPV-positive results in the reviewed studies were usually accompanied by abnormal cytology. This meant that we were unable to determine the relative impact of HPV vs. abnormal cytology for many of the emotions described. However, there were some emotions which seemed inherently related to HPV, such as sexual distress and test-speciﬁc distress. Receiving both HPV and cytology results is, nevertheless, reﬂective of routine screening practice, meaning that the ﬁndings of this review should provide valuable and pragmatic insights into the patient experience at screening. Limitations Our timely systematic review beneﬁts from the adoption of a relatively novel and rigorous mixed methods review design. Like most reviews, we have a number of limitations worth considering when interpreting the results. Firstly, although we used a comprehensive search strategy to identify papers across six major databases, our grey literature search was limited to OpenGrey and we did not contact authors or Listservs to identify additional literature. Also, given that there is no clear agreed or distinct theoretical deﬁnition for many emotions, emotion categorisations were often based on jud- gements and interpretations by the review team, especially where data was measured using non-vali- dated scales or qualitative data. The meta-analyses were also performed using small numbers of studies (range: 3 - 6) which can be unreliable and subject to bias, and prohibited moderator analyses. Therefore, relevant mechanisms could not be explored and caution is warranted in meta-analysis interpretations. Lastly, whilst we used the cognitive behavioural framework to map our ﬁndings, there are several other potentially more relevant theoretical models which could be used to structure emotional reactions to HPV; e.g., Williams’ Aﬀect and Health Behavioural Framework (Williams & Evans, 2014) or Leventhal’s Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (Leventhal et al., 2016). Using alternative theoretical frameworks may have led to diﬀerent formulations but we are conﬁdent that our overall conclusions are valid. Implications for policy and practice As HPV primary screening is being implemented around the world, our ﬁndings provide rich insight for policymakers and clinicians into women’s experience of receiving HPV-positive results. In attempts to mitigate adverse response, common themes highlighted in this review (e.g., related to confusion around cancer risk or sexual transmission) could be targeted through tailored information in screening result letters or accompanying leaﬂets. Clinicians working in primary care and cervical screening in areas where HPV-testing is being implemented could also use this information to pre- empt or address women’s questions and concerns, especially in low-and-middle-income countries where adverse emotional response may be greater. Public health or third sector organisations running campaigns on cervical cancer screening could frame their communications to target some of the key areas, e.g., to tackle stigma associated with sexually transmitted aspects. Clinical signpost- ing and pathways could also be embedded within cancer screening programmes to provide support for some of the sub-groups highlighted, who may be at higher risk of clinically important adverse responses (e.g., women from ethnic minority backgrounds, or those with low health literacy or without access to social support). HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 423

Conclusion Short-term anxiety, distress about test results, distress about sexual relationships, feelings of disgust and shame, surprise, and fear about cancer appear to be the most common emotional responses to testing positive for HPV. Almost exclusive use of observational and qualitative designs, however, limits conclusions regarding clinical signiﬁcance and prohibits some important causal inferences. We hope this comprehensive review, paired with our provisional framework of relevant emotion, cog- nitive and behavioural factors, will act as a springboard for the development of a cogent theoretical literature on this topic.
