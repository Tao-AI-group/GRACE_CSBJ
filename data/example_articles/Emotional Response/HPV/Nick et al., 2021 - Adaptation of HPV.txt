Various studies  report that positive human papillomavirus diagnosis results in psychosexual issues for the infected and reduces their  quality of life. However, the adaptation of the infected has not been addressed yet. The present study aims to identify  the process by which individuals infected with human papillomavirus adapt to their disease. Method:  This is a qualitative work of research with a grounded theory design. The setting of the study was the skin  clinic of Shahid Faghihi Hospital in Shiraz. The participants consisted of 27 individuals: 18 patients, 3 doctors, 2 counse- lors, and 4 spouses of patients. The subjects were selected via purposeful and theoretical sampling method until data  saturation was reached. Data were collected through face-to-face, in-depth, semi-structured interviews from April  2019 to December 2020. The collected data were analyzed using Corbin and Strauss’s method (2015) and MAXQDA  2018. Results:  The theory which emerged from the data was “trying to maintain resilience in the absence of psychological  security.” Analysis of data showed the main concern of participants in adapting to their diagnosis with human papillo- mavirus was “life stress”. “Stigma and ignorance” was found to be a contextual condition and “paradox in support” was  an intervening condition in the patients’ adaptation. The patients’ action/interaction responses to their main concern  in the context in question were “emotional confrontation” and “maintaining resilience.” The outcome was “oscillation  between tension and tranquility.” Conclusion:  The present study explains the process by which patients with human papillomavirus adapt to their  condition. Identification of the concerns of patients with human papillomavirus and the factors which affect their  adaptation can help healthcare policy-makers and providers develop effective support plans in order to increase  patients’ quality of life. Early interventions, e.g. counseling care providers to modify their behaviors toward alleviating  the psychosexual tension of the infected, can facilitate the adaptation of the infected and decrease the consequences  of the infection for them.

Page 2 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 Plain language summary  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common cause of sexually transmitted diseases. Almost all men and women  get the infection at least once throughout their lives. The high-risk types of HPV account for about 5% of cancer cases  globally. HPV can cause anogenital cancers and warts in both genders. In this grounded theory study, we conducted  27 in-depth interviews with Iranian patients, their spouses, and health care providers from April 2019 to December  2020. The collected data were analyzed using Corbin and Strauss’s method (2015) and MAXQDA 2018. The partici- pants were concerned about tension in family relationships, being stigmatized, getting cancer, recurrence of warts,  transferring their disease to others, and changes in the appearance of their genitalia. They stated that HPV is regarded  as a shameful disease in society. Most of the participants said they had never heard anything about HPV. The patients’  action/interaction responses to their concerns were “emotional confrontation” and “maintaining resilience.” These strat- egies helped the patients recover some of their tranquility. However, some of patients’ concerns were persistent and  kept them oscillating between tension and tranquility. An understanding of the patients’ perception of their disease is  essential to development of effective educational interventions to change patients’ perspective on their situation and  improve their recovery. Furthermore, because of the low level of public awareness about HPV and sexual health and  the flow of misinformation to the infected, it is recommended that educational interventions focus on the patients’  concerns.

Almost all men  and women get the infection at least once throughout  their lives [1]. The high-risk types of HPV account for  about 5% of cancer cases in the world, and approximately  570,000 women and 60,000 men contract HPV-related  cancers every year [2]. Adaptation to the disease is a complex, dynamic, peri- odic, and interactive process. This process is influenced  by a variety of factors, including one’s coping strategies,  personal characteristics, values, beliefs, and life experi- ences [3, 4], as well as the characteristics of the infection,  underlying factors, and social support, all of which are  interrelated [5, 6]. Also, adaptation is influenced by cul- ture [5]. There is an unspoken nature of sexuality in Ira- nian culture [7] since in this culture, sexual matters are  regulated by limitations, taboos, and unwritten rules [8].  Successful adaptation to HPV requires comprehensive  physical and psychological adaptation, and an under- standing of this process entails an investigation of the  underlying factors [9]. A review of literature shows that the studies conducted  on HPV are mostly focused on women, and such matters  as quality of life [10], marital adaptation to the infection  (using a quantitative approach) [11], vaccination [12], the  psycho-sexual effects of being diagnosed with HPV [13,  14], women’s experiences of facing their infection [15],  women’s psychological responses to positive HPV test  [16], the information management processes of women  living with HPV [17], and reproductive concerns of HPV-  positive women [18]. Research findings show that testing  positive for human papillomavirus is accompanied by  feelings of shame, stigma, self-deprecation, regret, anxi- ety and concern [16, 18, 19]. To the best knowledge of the  authors, no work of research has addressed the process of  adaptation in men and women with HPV. Only one work  of research has addressed the psychosocial adaptation of  women diagnosed with HPV. According to this study, the  sexual and psychological adaptation of women diagnosed  with HPV was achieved after 6 months. But, this study  does not deal with the coping strategies and conditions  of the infected and does not conduct an in-depth analysis  of the experiences of the infected due to its quantitative  approach [20]. A study of this process can help identify  patients’ main concerns, their coping strategies and the  factors affecting their adaptation, and this information  can be used by healthcare policy-makers. Also, nations  worldwide are developing plans to promote global health,  which requires relevant and context-sensitive evidence  to support their policies and interventions [21]. Thus, we  proposed the following research question: “How patients  diagnosed with HPV adapt to their diagnosis?” and the  aim of the present study was to explore this adaptation  process. Method Study design The present study is a qualitative work with a grounded  theory design, conducted from April 2019 to December  2020. Grounded theory answers the question of how indi- viduals respond to events or handle problems through  action and interaction [22].The setting of the study was  the skin clinic of Shahid Faghihi Hospital in Shiraz. It is  a referral center for patients with HPV diagnosis with or  without skin manifestation in the south of Iran. Twenty- seven people participated in the study: 18 patients, 3  doctors, 2 counselors, and 4 spouses of patients. At first,  subjects were selected via purposeful sampling. Next,  based on the concepts and categories extracted from the  initial data, the researchers employed theoretical sam- pling to collect more data. Analyses of the first 8 inter- views raised questions about the reactions of the spouses  of patients with HPV. Accordingly, interviews 9, 13, 24,  and 26 were conducted with the spouses of 4 patients  with HPV. As all of the participants referred to the role of  healthcare providers, 5 interviews were conducted with  the members of this population. To learn about as many  viewpoints as possible, the researchers applied maximum  variation sampling in terms of age, gender, virus type,  occupation, education, length of infection, marital status,  number of children, and type of sexual relationship. The  healthcare providers were selected from both the public  and private sectors. The inclusion criteria for the patients  were having been diagnosed with HPV as confirmed by  a doctor’s certificate or having positive HPV test results  and willingness to participate in the study. The exclusion  criteria were having cancer, HPV-related cancer, Low and  High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial lesions or a differ- ent type of sexually transmitted disease. Only one of the  patients at the clinic refused to participate in the study  due to professional reasons. The patients’ trust in the first author was enhanced by  the following factors: the doctors’ trust in the researcher,  the researcher’s regular presence at the clinic, answering  the patients’ questions and providing them with reliable  information, the researchers’ affiliation with a university,  the doctors’ referring patients to the researcher, and the  researcher’s physical presence in the clinic in a room of  her own. In addition, the patients had been informed that  refusal to participate in the study would not affect the  process of their treatment. Data collection method Data were collected through individual, face-to-face, in- depth, semi-structured interviews. The interviews were 

Page 4 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 conducted by N.N. and each lasted from 30 to 100 min.  Most of the interviews were conducted in a quiet room at  the clinic and were recorded on a voice recorder. 3 of the  participants who did not feel comfortable about being  interviewed at the clinic were interviewed at places of  their choice. Due to the spread of the coronavirus, par- ticipant 18 was interviewed online. The healthcare pro- viders were interviewed at their workplace. At the time of  each interview, the interviewer and the participant were  alone. One of the participants was interviewed twice for  further clarification of some points raised during the first  interview. Thus, in total, 28 interviews were conducted. Each interview with the patients started with a few gen- eral, open-ended questions related to the main research  objective followed by questions which casually came up  in the course of the interviews. The first question was,  “Can you tell me about the first time when you found  out you had the infection?” One of the main questions  was, “What were your experiences when you told others  about the result of your diagnosis?” Based on the partici- pants’ answers, exploratory questions were asked: “Can  you explain that more?” or “Can you give an example?”  The concluding question was, “Is there anything else you  would like to add or talk about something I might have  missed?”. One of the questions which the spouses of the patients  were asked was, “Can you tell me about the first time  when your spouse talked to you about his/her infection?”  An example of the questions which the healthcare pro- viders were asked is, “What are your experiences of the  reactions of patients or their companions when they are  told that they have the infection?” Data collection con- tinued until the data was saturated. In the present study,  field note was also taken alongside the interviews and  they were coded in the process of data analysis. Data analysis The collected data were analyzed according to Corbin and  Strauss’ method (2015). The stages of data analysis con- sisted of: open coding, determining concepts, developing  the concepts and determining their characteristics and  dimensions, analyzing data for context, bringing the pro- cess into the analysis, and integrating the categories [22].  Soon after the first interview, the process of data analysis  began. Immediately after conducting each interview, N.  N. listened to the recording carefully and transcribed it  word by word. Subsequently, the handwritten transcripts  were typed and compared to the audio files. Then the  scripts were entered into MAXQDA 2018 and the open  coding was performed. All the authors participated in the  process of data analysis. The data were collected, coded,  and analyzed simultaneously. Throughout the study, the  researchers applied such analytical methods as constant  comparison, questioning and waving the red flag. Also,  the researchers used memos throughout the analytical  process. The credibility of the data were ensured using Corbin  and Strauss’s criteria [22]. Prolonged engagement, maxi- mum variation, peer checking, member checking, exter- nal auditing, and complete description of the participants  and research settings were used to confirm the data  credibility. Also, the experiences of C. T. and R. J. in the  field of grounded theory enhanced the credibility of the  research findings. The researchers were careful to avoid  bias and letting their predetermined ideas affect the data.  The interview transcripts and parts of the findings were  given to the participants who were asked to confirm  them. Research team and reflexivity This article is part of the Ph.D. thesis of First author. C  T. and R. J. were experienced in grounded theory pro- jects. Also, the professional field of all the authors was  related to the research topic, which enhanced the theo- retical sensitivity of the study. The research process was  carried out directly by the researchers. The research team  consisted of man and woman members, all of whom had  training and experience in research and publication.  There was no relationship or conflict of interest between  the researchers and participants. The participants were  informed about the research topic and objectives before  being interviewed. Ethical considerations The present research has been approved by the ethics  committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, reg- istered at IR.SUMS.REC.1398.431. All the participants  filled out the informed consent form. For ethical consid- erations, before being interviewed, the participants were  informed about the research objectives, the voluntary  basis of their participation, their right to withdraw, the  confidentiality of their information, and the use of a voice  recorder during the interviews. Results The age range of the patients was 19 to 50 years. 66.7% of  the patients were married. Tables 1 and 2 show the other  demographic characteristics of the participants. The number of codes extracted from the 28 inter- views was 4098 which fell to 1207 after the repeated  codes were merged. Data reduction continued with con- stant comparison and interaction with the data. At first,  136 sub-sub-subcategories were extracted which were  finally reduced to 79. As the analytical process went on,  the labels which were related to the same concept were  put together to form conceptual categories on higher

The categories abstracted from data  analysis are shown in Table 3. The aim of the present study was to explore the pro- cess of adjustment of patients who tested positive for  HPV. The main concern of the patients was found to be  life stress. They repeatedly referred to experiencing stress  in their lives. Their concern developed in the context of  stigma and ignorance and under the influence of paradox  in support. The patients used various coping strategies to  deal with their issues. Overreacting, mental rumination,  changing the truth, mental tension, obsessive behaviors,  and social isolation were the strategies which were used  initially. For fear of stigma or creating tension at home,  some of the patients deprived themselves of the emo- tional support of the people around them. Yet, the oth- ers sought emotional support from their families, friends  and healthcare providers. Other strategies used by the  patients were boosting their tolerance and changing their  lifestyle to improve an unpleasant situation. These strate- gies were not employed separately and in a linear man- ner, but were interrelated and sometimes, following a  change in conditions, appeared simultaneously. Overall, their coping strategies to manage their con- cerns took the form of emotional confrontation and try- ing to maintain resilience. The participants mentioned  that the strategies they applied enabled them to have  relatively normal lives, but any reference to their infec- tion would make them tense again. Considering the fre- quent changes which they experienced and their many  concerns, the participants were inclined toward adapta- tion, but oscillated between tension and tranquility in the  process. In the present study, based on the participants’  behaviors and the results of the categorization process,  Table 2  The demographic characteristics of the healthcare providers and the patients’ spouses a At the time of the interviews, these patients’ spouses did not have any symptoms of HPV and had not run any diagnostic tests, so their infection status was  undetermined b These patients’ spouses had tested negative for HPV No. Gender Age Occupation Work experience  (yrs.)

Page 7 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 	 “trying to maintain resilience in the absence of psycho- logical security” was selected as the core category which  connected all the categories and concepts extracted from  the collected data. The theory which emerged from the  analysis of data is shown in Fig. 1. In the following sec- tions, the details of this process will be presented. Main concern: life stress The dimensions of this concept are “having a sense of  chaos in life” and “having a sense of insecurity in life.” Having a sense of chaos in life The participants mentioned that following their diag- nosis, their spouses lost their psychological balance  (e.g. they became aggressive, cried frequently, or got  depressed). My wife was really upset, she cried all the time. She  was a different person. Our life was so stressful. We  were always arguing with each other. (Participant  3, patient). The tension in marital relationships had resulted in  many issues for the couples, ranging from a temporary  lack of communication to emotional divorce and actual  divorce in some cases. The tension affected not only the  marital relationships, but the relationships between the  other members of the families. Things were a mess at home …. The kids would  cry and tell me, ‘You’re a bad mom. We wish you  weren’t our mom.’ (Participant 5, patient). Concern about the spread of the infection in the fam- ily and the issue of unfaithfulness were among the rea- sons which the participants mentioned to explain the  chaotic atmosphere in their families. Having a sense of insecurity in life One of the concerns of all the participants was fear of  being stigmatized by the society and their families. They  were worried that if others found out about their unlaw- ful relationships, they would face disgrace, be called  names, and be ostracized.

Page 8 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 Others would call us immoral people, they would  say we must have been having affairs. (Participant  16, patient). The participants stated that because the disease was  infectious, they were worried about transferring the  infection to their sexual partners. They also expressed  their concern about infecting their future spouses and  their babies if they became pregnant. One of the partici- pants said, I was thinking if I get married now, I will give  the infection to my husband. Or if I want to have a baby, it  will affect my baby (Participant 10, patient). In addition, the knowledge that they have HPV and  that the virus can cause cancer results in the infected  being haunted by fear of cancer and even death. When my test result showed it was malicious, I told  my husband I felt terrible. When he asked why, I  said they told me it’s malicious. I’m afraid of cancer.  (Participant 17, patient). The patients were also worried about recurrence of  their genital warts, the possibility of carrying the virus  even after recovery and having the infection as a chronic  disease, and changes in the appearance of their genitalia  because of the warts or scars left by treatment. One of  the participants said, I’m scared. This disease is incurable  and the virus will be in my body forever. (Participant 6,  patient). Data analysis for context Context is a combination of all the circumstances that  constitute a situation and includes the patients’ reasons  for their interactions. In the present study, the contextual  condition of a context of stigma and ignorance, which  included the socio-political conditions which had influ- enced the patients’ experiences, and the intervening con- dition of paradox in support were perceived as facilitators  or inhibitors in the process of adaptation [22]. Context of stigma and ignorance The participants stated that extramarital sexual relation- ships are unacceptable to the society and family and are  regarded as taboo, and personal, social, and family beliefs  are affected by this taboo. The fact that HPV is regarded  as a shameful disease. This disease is like a label which is attached to you  and never comes off. (Participant 8, patient). In some cases, the patients were frequently asked ques- tions about how they had been infected by the people  around them who were curious about their disease. The  participants mentioned that the cultural taboo about dis- cussing sexual matters prevents adolescents from receiv- ing systematic and continuous education about puberty  and sexual relationships and continue to engage in high- risk behaviors. One of the participants said, I didn’t know  much about safe sex. If I had, I wouldn’t be here now. (Par- ticipant 2, patient). It was also pointed out that in the absence of proper  sex education, the role of the family becomes very impor- tant. In the present study, only one of the participants  was found to have received this kind of education from  his family. The rest of them had started their sexual rela- tionships with ignorance about how to lead a healthy sex  life. In addition, the authorities’ inaction about HPV has  resulted in public ignorance about the disease. Many of  the participants complained that the healthcare system  was keeping quiet about the disease and was not using  the media to inform the public. I’m 33 years old now. I had heard people talk about  human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and hepa- titis many times, but I’d never heard anything about  HPV. (Participant 1, patient). The participants mentioned that lack of awareness  about the nature of HPV results in people’s not taking  preventive or curative measures, including being vacci- nated, practicing safe sex following infection, and seeking  medical attention for their genital warts at a healthcare  center before it is too late. Many of the participants  attributed their delay in seeking medical attention to their  unawareness about the infection. One of the doctors said,  Most patients don’t have much information about this  infection. They often mistake their warts for moles and are  late in seeking treatment. (Participant 4, doctor). Participants mentioned that the content of social  media, including websites on the Internet and Insta- gram, on diseases is uploaded by individuals many of  whom do not have any specialized knowledge of medi- cine. Also, because much of this content is out-of-date  and inconsistent, it adds to patients’ concern. Many of  the participants stated that the social media presents an  exaggerated picture of cancer associated with HPV, occa- sionally compares HPV to HIV, and misinforms them  about available treatments, all of which adds to their  anxiety. One of my concerns is the information patient find  on Google. Much of what it says there is related  to cancer. You don’t find much about differences  between various types of viruses and their impacts  on developing a particular cancer. (Participant 1,  counselor).

Page 9 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 	 Paradox in support “A number of participants reported the experience of  receiving support. The sources of this supportiveness  included family, friends, and health service providers.  One of the doctors said, I tell my patients not to worry as  the virus often clears up. The virus certainly disappears at  ages below 30 years, leaving no causes for concern. (Par- ticipant 3, doctor)” [23]. However, in some cases they  experienced lack of support from relatives and health  service providers. “One of the participants said, We are  truly alone in life. Right now, there is no one around and  this makes the problem worse. (Participant 3)” [23]. In  fact, Patient’s’ interactions with different people resulted  in different and, in many cases, contradictory experi- ences for them. The support which the infected receive  from the people close to them (including the family and  friends) and healthcare providers is an intervening condi- tion in the adaptation process of patients with HPV [23]. Data analysis for process The patients’ action/interaction strategies with regard to  stress in life in the context of stigma and ignorance fell  into two categories: “emotional confrontation” and “try- ing to maintain resilience.” Emotional confrontation The concept of emotional confrontation consists of  “stressful cognitive process” and “struggling with mental  pressure.” Stressful cognitive process  The patients’ mental picture  of their disease as a monster or terrible disaster stems  from stress in life under the conditions. One of them men- tioned, My child was only 3. She died in my own arms. It  was very painful. I don’t know what to say. I just know that,  yeah, my child’s death was terrible, but when I was told I  had this infection, it felt worse. (The patient cried at this  point). I wish I had a heart disease or MS or had become  paralyzed instead of getting this disease. (Participant 4,  patient). In addition to stress in life, contextual conditions and  the treatment teams’ interactions with the patients aggra- vated the patients’ tension. A few of the participants  referred to the social media as the main cause of their  anxiety and need to see a counselor. Some of the patients  mentioned that after their diagnosis, they kept compar- ing themselves with other patients and tried to remem- ber their relatives’ experiences of cancer or HIV—they  said that the thought of their disease haunted them. As  soon as they had been diagnosed with HPV, some of the  patients were haunted by the suspicion that their spouses  were cheating on them. Well, they’re usually suspicious of their spouses and  the love that they felt for each other before is gone.  I mean they keep wondering how their spouses had  gotten the infection. (Participant 8, doctor). On the other hand, the person who transfers the infec- tion has a guilty conscience and constantly blames him/ herself for having engaged in high-risk behaviors. Some  individuals become obsessive and suffer from hypochon- dria or fear of transferring their disease or spread of the  disease to other parts of their body. I couldn’t help worrying. I thought if I drank water  from a glass and then my brother drank from it, he  would get sick too. Or when I touched the water taps,  I was worried they would touch them too and get  infected. (Participant 15, patient). Struggling with mental pressure  All of the patients had  experienced mental pressure and most of them had cried  after being diagnosed with the infection. Some had con- templated taking revenge on their spouses or the society  or committing suicide—some had actually attempted sui- cide. Recurrent nightmares, insomnia, turning to super- stitions, and threatening their spouses with cheating were  among the issues which the participants mentioned. I wanted to kill myself, to put a string around my  neck and suffocate myself. I was fed-up with my life.  (Participant 16, patient). The patients’ reactions to the news that they were  infected included indifference to satisfaction of their  basic needs, lack of motivation, depression, emptiness,  and meaninglessness of life and its interests. The whole world has turned black for me. I have no  hope for my life. I just want to die. (Participant 1,  patient). Some of the patients were suffering from appetite loss,  lethargy, failure at school or work, less interest in life,  and indifference to their appearances. The findings of  the study showed that all the patients were displaying  obsessive behaviors, including obsession about hygiene,  repeated examination of their bodies, repeated visits to  their therapists, and asking repeated questions. One of the patients said, ‘I wash my hands ten times  a day and have separated my dishes from the rest of  the family. (Participant 1, counselor). Many of the patients mentioned that they were obses- sive about examining their bodies because they were  worried about recurrence of their genital warts, increase  in their number, or spread of the infection to other parts 

Page 10 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 of their bodies, including the throat. One of them said,  “I’m always holding a mirror, checking my genitalia” (Par- ticipant 6, patient). Following their diagnosis with HPV, many of the  patients limited their social interactions, became  reserved, or decided to stay single. Some patients  explained that they opted to stay single because they did  not want to be despised and reprimanded or enter a mar- riage with an uncertain future because of their sexually  transmitted disease. Some of the other patients had quit  their jobs, decreased or ended their contact with their  friends and family, or reduced their social interactions.  Some of the infected had stopped having sex temporar- ily following their diagnosis and some of them had aban- doned sexual relationships even though a few years had  passed since their infection. My sexual relationships were down to zero. I could  not be with anyone for the first three months. (Par- ticipant 2, patient). To avoid telling the truth about how they had been  infected, the patients named swimming pools, sauna, or  their friends’ clothes as the sources of their infection. Trying to maintain resilience Trying to maintain resilience consisted of the concepts of  “seeking help” and “making the best of a bad situation.” Seeking help  All the participants referred to the need of  the infected for support from friends and family, psychol- ogists, psychiatrists, and healthcare providers. At some point, you would give anything just to be  able to talk to someone. (Participant 2, patient). To satisfy their need for emotional support, the  infected seek support from the people around them or  healthcare providers. I was so scared and crying. It was  10 at night. I called my sister and begged her to come and  help me. I was just crying. (Participant 6, patient). The participants also mentioned that it is very impor- tant that healthcare providers consider the psychologi- cal needs of the infected in their interactions with them.  Also, all of the patients searched for information on the  Internet to increase their knowledge of the disease and  learn about other people’s experiences of their infection.  In addition to the Internet, the patients tried to get infor- mation from their friends, other patients, and healthcare  providers. Making the best of a bad situation  One of the coping  strategies of the patients was increasing their resilience.  This strategy included such behaviors as reassuring their  spouse/sexual partner, ignoring their family’s critical atti- tude, turning to religion, keeping their infection secret,  hoping that things get better with time, accepting the  situation, and keeping themselves busy with other things.  One of the participants said, My mom and dad constantly  scolded me. So I just decided to ignore them. I didn’t care  anymore? (Participant 9, patient). Some of the patients stated that after their diagnosis  with HPV, they tried to reduce their stress by turning to  God and other sources of spirituality. Secrecy was a strat- egy employed by all the patients to avoid stigma, implica- tions about how they had been infected, and the negative  reactions of the people around them. Even now, nobody knows I’m here [at the clinic]. I  just told them I was going out. I don’t want anyone  to know. (Participant 5, patient). Sometimes, the patients conclude that their concerns,  which are the source of their stress in life, are endless and  since they cannot eliminate them, they should wait for  time to improve the situation. Some of the patients said  that their strategy was to accept the situation or just take  it easy. Some of the other patients kept themselves busy  with other things, e.g. housework and playing music, to  keep their minds off their infection. I try to be in my workplace so I can keep busy and  not think about it. (Participant 8, patient). Changing lifestyle was another strategy used by the  patients. They used traditional medicine, improved their  nutrition and sleeping habits and exercised to strengthen  their immune system in the hope of eliminating the virus  from their body. I’ve decided not to eat any more fast food or pro- cessed foods. (Participant 10, patient). Some had quit high-risk sexual behaviors and some  others had taken the vaccine and underwent screening to  avoid contracting other viruses and prevent their infec- tion from developing into cancer. Consequence: oscillation between tension and tranquility The findings of the study showed that the consequence  of the patients’ action-interaction in relation to stress in  life—their main concern—was “oscillation between ten- sion and tranquility.” This category consists of the con- cepts of “mental exhaustion” and “achieving relative  tranquility.” Mental exhaustion As mentioned above, because of their fear of being  stigmatized, some of the interviewed patients did not  seek help from others and their isolation in the fam- ily made their situation more complicated. Moreover, 

Page 11 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 	 the inefficacy of some of their coping strategies made  them feel incompetent, inefficient and self-alienated and  undermined their self-confidence and self-esteem. What good can two sick people [referring to himself  and his wife] have for the society? Why should we  live? (Participant 16, patient). Stress in life, lack of awareness, inconsistency in the  content available on the Internet, and contradictory  information given by healthcare providers confuse the  patients. Some of the patients were afraid to have sexual  relationships again and the fear lasted in some cases. I’ve started to hate having sex. I don’t even want to  think about it. When my husband approaches me, I  feel disgusted, I’m scared [she is crying]. (Participant  6, patient). Unsupportive behaviors on the part of the patients’  friends, family and care providers, including putting  them under pressure, rejecting them, and scolding them,  were disturbing to the patients. Having genital warts,  being treated by others with scorn, and being criticized  by their families created feelings of frustration and shame  in the patients. The participants stated that, despite the  coping strategies which they applied, some continuing  concerns filled their lives with apprehension. Some of the  participants used the phrase “like hell” to describe their  lives. I’m really nervous. We haven’t had any sexual rela- tionships with each other for many years now. This is  not living. This is being in hell. When you’re always  stressed about if you’ll get cancer or not, your life  will be like hell. (Participant 1, patient). Tension in marital relationships led to many issues,  ranging from frequent quarrels to sexual dissatisfaction. Achieving relative tranquility Certain coping strategies, including adopting a spiritual  lifestyle, seeing a psychologist, and taking tranquilizers,  were found to have created relative tranquility in the  patients. I wanted to go to a place where I could have peace.  Visiting Shahcheragh [a holy shrine] made me feel so  calm. (Participant 17, patient). A few of the participants mentioned that when some of  their concerns, including the risk of their transferring the  infection to their families, safe methods of having sex and  their chances of having cancer, were eliminated, they felt  less stressed. They stated that they could laugh again like  before, resumed their professional activities, attended to  their household affairs, and took up their social activities  again. Before that, I didn’t feel like taking my daughter to  her ballet class and this had a terrible effect on her  spirits. I hit my son a lot. I didn’t cook. But now I talk  to my kids; we laugh; I take them to their classes; I  cook. (Participant 5, patient). Some of the patients mentioned that they felt less  stressed after they obtained the right information about  HPV, including that facts that only the high-risk types  of the virus can cause cancer in the long run which can  be detected in the early stages of development through  screening, the virus can be eliminated by the immune  system, genital warts are treatable, infections caused by  the low-risk types of the virus are benign, and HPV had a  high prevalence rate. When I was told that I won’t transfer it my family,  I felt so calm; it was such a relief. (Participant 7,  patient). The above-mentioned strategies helped the patients  recover some of their tranquility. However, the persis- tence of some of their concerns kept the patients oscil- lating between tension and tranquility. The domain of  consequences is a dynamic spectrum affected by contex- tual and intervening conditions and each patient can be  placed at a certain point on the spectrum. I tried … I mean I have to accept it and stop think- ing about it. Even though it’s been more than a year  now, I still can’t help thinking about it; it’s always on  my mind … I keep saying, ‘well, what can I do?’ …  Then I tell myself to forget it and this cycle just goes  on. (Participant 18, patient). Discussion “Trying to maintain resilience in the absence of psycho- logical security” was the theory which emerged from  the analysis of data in the present study. Management of  HPV is adversely affected by such factors as false beliefs  about the infection [24], concern about controlling the  symptoms, the risk of developing cervical cancer, fear of  transferring the infection to one’s embryo or sexual part- ner, recurrence, mortality and incurability of the disease  [14, 15, 19, 25], all of which are confirmed by the find- ings of the present study. According to a study, in addi- tion to women infected with the high-risk types of the  virus, women with the low-risk types also worry about  developing cervical cancer. They attribute their concern  to the possibility of contracting the high-risk types of the  virus [17]. On a similar note, the results of the present  study show that the wrong information provided by some 

Page 12 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 healthcare providers and the social media about the like- lihood of a low-risk HPV changing to a high-risk HPV,  the patients infected with the low-risk types of the virus  are worried about developing cancer too. Another study reports that women with abnormal cer- vical cytology are worried about the impact of the disease  on their fertility [26]. However, in the present study, the  patients (both man and woman) were concerned about  the possibility of the infection being transferred to their  embryos or babies during pregnancy or at birth. The dis- crepancy between the research results may be due to the  differences between the participants of the two studies.  In the former study, the participants consisted of women  with abnormal cytology, while the participants in the pre- sent study did not have any signs of pathologic cellular  changes. The results of the present study also show that the con- cerns of the infected include disruption to family rela- tionships and tension in marital relationships after testing  positive for HPV, which agrees with the findings of other  studies [15, 27].The participants attributed the disruption  to family relationships to taboos about unlawful relation- ships, suspecting one’s spouse of having affairs, and the  contagious nature of HPV. In the present study, many of the participants had  experienced being judged and disrespected by their fami- lies, the healthcare system, and the whole society, which  added to their tension. Other studies have reported simi- lar results [15, 28]. The number of studies conducted on  men infected with HPV is quite small. One study reports  that women are more likely to experience the stigma  associated with HPV than men are [28]. The participants  in the present study affirmed that, as a result of sociocul- tural beliefs, the issue of stigma is more serious for single  women than single men; however, with regard to married  men and women, the difference was not significant. The  discrepancy between the results of the two studies can be  attributed to differences between their methodologies:  the former study is a quantitative work, while the pre- sent study has used a qualitative approach and includes  an in-depth analysis of the patients’ experiences. Also, in  the present study, the patients stated that the emotional  and informational support of their friends, families, and  healthcare providers raised their spirits. Likewise, other  studies report that emotional/informational support and  positive social interactions improve the psychological  well-being and treatment results of patients with HIV  [29] and reduce their levels of depression [30]. The greatest sociocultural barrier to sex education  in Iran is the taboos about sexual relationships and dis- cussing matters related to sex. In addition, ignorance in  most families about sexual matters results in teenagers’  experiencing their first sexual relationships with little  awareness of sexual health [31]. In the Iranian-Islamic  culture, families and the society are reticent about sexual  matters, including sex education [32], as confirmed by  the views of the participants in the present study. These  obstacles can be overcome with the support of organiza- tions in the public and private sectors and policy-makers  toward empowering families and teachers to raise teen- agers’ sexual health awareness [31]. Patients use the social media to increase their knowl- edge about their infection and to find doctors. The media  also enable patients to interact with other patients as  well as doctors. However, it is hard to evaluate the trust- worthiness of these sources of information and mislead- ing information can be harmful to patients [33]. Studies  confirm the significant role of media in alleviating the  adverse psychosocial effects of HIV [34]. The findings of  the present study show the same outcome with patients  infected with HPV. However, the manner of transferring  information and the quality of the information provided  are very important: only high-quality content on media  can make an impression on people’s minds; informa- tion of low quality will repel its audience and aggravate  the current discriminatory behaviors in the society [34].  The participants in the present study also referred to the  role of media, but much of the content obtained by the  patients came from weblogs and personal accounts on  Instagram as the national media in Iran do not usually  address HPV. The results of a study show that the process of organ- izing data on women infected with HPV is complex,  non-linear, and irregular. Some women make immedi- ate responses to positive diagnosis results, while oth- ers’ responses appear over time. Immediate responses  include shock and confusion due to lack of knowledge.  The infected start to search for information on the  Internet and from healthcare providers. Learning about  the consequences of HPV—genital warts and cancer— changes their shock to fear [17]. Similarly, in addition  to the above, the results of the present study show that  the patients’ repeated visits to healthcare providers and  receiving contradictory information from them and the  social media add to their fear and confusion. In addition,  following the shock of their realization that they were  infected, the patients in the present study wanted to dis- tort the truth about their infection, especially about how  they had been infected, which is the result of the domi- nant cultural-religious beliefs in Iran. Patients diagnosed with HPV also experience shame,  stigma, regret, self-reproach [19], disruption to their  relationships, negative impact on their social relation- ships, inclination to hide their test results, obsession with  cleanliness, preference for distant clinical interactions  e.g. using e-mail to receive their test results, fewer social 

Page 13 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 	 interactions, and disruption to their sexual performance  [13, 14, 27]. Women patients’ negative responses at the  time of their diagnosis and thereafter adversely affect  their sexual behaviors and marital adjustment. Sexual  dissatisfaction and unsafe attachment undermine cou- ples’ marital adjustment [35], which is consistent with the  results of the present study. According to a study, after  being diagnosed with HPV, women display negative feel- ings, including anger, confusion, depression and shock,  while men rarely respond in this manner [28]. In the pre- sent study, however, the man patients had experienced  negative feelings too. The discrepancy can be attributed  to the differences between the methodology of the for- mer study (quantitative) and that of the present study  (qualitative). Fear of stigma causes the infected to adopt the strat- egy of hiding the truth [14]. In the present study, many of  the patients had hidden their infection from the people  around them (except for their spouses and, in some cases,  first-degree relatives) for fear of being labeled. The results  of a study in Iran show that personal responses to test- ing positive for HPV include marital conflicts, inclination  to divorce, concealing one’s infection from one’s sexual  partner and not taking one’s infection seriously [15]. On  the contrary, in the present study, most of the patients,  both man and woman, had informed their spouses or  sexual partners of their infection, but, to avoid stigma,  had kept it hidden from their other family members and  friends. Many had informed their spouses to prevent  infecting them. Also, none of the patients in the present  study showed signs of indifference to their infection after  having been diagnosed with HPV. One of the concerns of  the patients in the present study was having a guilty con- science about transferring their infection to their sexual  partners, a finding not reported by other studies. This  difference can be attributed to the fact that, unlike other  similar studies, the participants in the present study con- sisted of both genders. In the present study, the man  patients felt guiltier about infecting their sexual partners,  which can be because men are more likely to be engaged  in unlawful relationships [36, 37] and most of the mar- ried women in the present study had been infected by  their husbands. In a study in the U.S., the woman participants were  found to have accepted their infection with HPV as a  chronic disease due to its uncontrollable nature and  suppressed their thoughts in an attempt to adapt to the  uncertain conditions of their disease. However, when  they were accidentally exposed to information, their  attempts at thought suppression were futile [17]. This  finding agrees with the results of the present study where  the participants used such strategies as seeking help,  increasing resilience and changing lifestyles, besides  thought repression, to adapt to their situation. The  results of a quantitative study show that the most com- mon mechanisms employed by individuals with clinical  symptoms of HPV are planning, active adaptation, self- reproach, seeking emotional support, positive reframing,  and acceptance; the least frequently applied mechanisms  are turning to religion and drug abuse [38]. In the present  study, however, turning to religion as a coping strategy  was one of the most common adaptation mechanisms  used by the patients. The reason for this discrepancy can  be the cultural differences between the two countries and  the prominence of religion in Iranian societies [39]. The  results of studies conducted in Iran indicate that reli- gious and spiritual practices improve the psychological  well-being and quality of life of patients with chronic dis- eases, e.g. multiple sclerosis [40], reduce mental tension  in patients who receive dialysis [41], and facilitate adapta- tion [42] and self-care [43] in patients with cancer. As literature reviews show, so far few studies have  used a quantitative approach to address the adaptation  of woman patients with HPV over time [20, 44]. Accord- ing to one quantitative study, 12 months after their diag- nosis, patients with HPV still reported certain levels of  psychosexual anxiety which, as the authors explain, may  have been the result of their responding to the question- naire—response bias [44]. In the above-mentioned study,  women with a history of HPV who tested negative at the  time of the study still had psychosexual concerns due to  their fear of recurrence of their infection in the future.  The authors conclude that the subjects may have had  reasons for their psychosexual concerns 12 months after  diagnosis, but the quantitative design of the study does  not allow for examining those reasons, thus they suggest  qualitative research for investigating why the concerns of  the infected persist [44]. Studies report that the greatest  long-term concern of women infected with HPV is that  their disease is infectious [13, 44]. In the present study,  also, the participants mentioned that their concerns con- tinued over time. According to a quantitative study, the  psychosocial adaptation of women diagnosed with HPV  is dynamic in nature [20]. Likewise, the coping strategies  of the patients in the present study changed according to  their conditions and the patients were in a state of oscilla- tion between tension and tranquility. The authors of the  above-mentioned study state that the infected can achieve  sexual and psychological adaptation after 6 months, but in  terms of health care orientation, more time is need. One  of the limitations of this study is that it does not address  the coping strategies and conditions of the patients; also,  due to its quantitative methodology, it lacks an in-depth  analysis of the patients’ experiences [20]. Studies show that treatment of genital warts and initia- tion of sexual relationships can reduce anxiety in patients 

Page 14 of 16 Nick et al. Reproductive Health  2021, 18(1):213 with HPV and facilitate their psychosocial adaptation [20,  45]. In the present study, the anxiety levels of the patients  decreased over time and many of them reinitiated their  sexual relationships. But, as the patients stated, due to  their various concerns and the impact of their conditions,  the quality of their sexual relationships was not the same  as it was before their infection. In the present study, the  single men had reinitiated their sexual relationships while  practicing safe sexual behaviors, but the married men  who were rejected by their wives had not been able to  establish their former sexual relationships. In summary, the theory which emerged from the find- ings showed that the patients’ main concern was life  stress. The stigma of having STDs and the society’s poor  awareness about HPV affect the patients’ perception of  their disease and how they and their families react to  their testing positive for HPV. The strategies used by the  patients to cope with their stress were emotional con- frontation and maintaining resilience. The outcome of  these interactions and strategies was oscillation between  tension and tranquility. Identification of the patients’  concerns and the conditions which affect their adapta- tion can help healthcare policy-makers and providers  develop and implement supportive programs to improve  the quality of life of the infected. One of the strengths of the present study is its use of  the grounded theory approach which allowed for devel- oping a theory based on the cultural and social context of  patients infected with HPV. In addition, the focus of most  previous studies in this field has been women, while the  participants in the present study consisted of both man  and woman patients with HPV, healthcare providers, and  spouses of patients. The study limitations also comprised  failure to find homosexuals of either gender despite mak- ing great efforts to observe maximum variation in select- ing the key participants and failure to interview with only  bisexual participants. Another limitation of the study  might be the gender difference between the woman  interviewer and man participants. This gender difference  might affect the men’s responses to some questions. Conclusion In the present study, the researchers used the grounded  theory approach to describe the adaptation process of  patients with HPV. The results showed that adaptation  to being diagnosed with HPV is a dynamic and context- dependent process. In this process, patients tried to  maintain resilience in the absence of psychological secu- rity. Among the influential factors in the dynamics of this  process and oscillation between tension and tranquil- ity were a context of stigma and ignorance and paradox  in support. The findings of the present study stress the  need for the establishment of a standard approach to  treatment of genital warts in clinical centers, especially  in the private sector, allocation of capable counselors to  clinics for patients with HPV, and eliminating the stigma  associated with the infection in the healthcare system  and the society. In addition, an understanding of the patients’ percep- tion of their disease is essential to development of effec- tive educational interventions whose aim is change the  patients’ perspective on their situation and improve their  recovery. Also, in view of the low level of public aware- ness about HPV and sexual health and provision of  wrong information to the infected, it is recommended  that educational interventions focus on the patients’  concerns. Timely interventions, including counseling  services to alleviate the psychosexual tension of testing  positive for HPV, can improve the patients’ adaptation  and protect them from the potential harms of the infec- tion. Accordingly, it is suggested that future studies be  centered around developing consultative-educational  programs based on the needs of patients with HPV and  evaluate the effectiveness of those programs on the qual- ity of life of the patients.
