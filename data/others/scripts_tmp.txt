Here is Christopher's story. I was getting ready to go out to dinner and I was shaving my neck when felt a bump. I had a bad cold so I thought it was a swollen gland. But it didn’t go away so I had it checked out by an ENT doctor in Los Angeles where I live. The diagnosis confused me. I never smoked or chewed tobacco and did not drink heavily. But I had a risk factor that 80% of adults also have – exposure to HPV.Like Christopher's story, almost all the people are in risk of HPV infection. Do you understand the seriousness of HPV infection?

High-risk HPV strains cause about 70% of cervical cancers. Women who need treatment to remove HPV-related cervical cancer or precancerous cells can become infertile. Other high-risk HPV strains can cause throat cancer and genital warts in men and women. Don’t risk your health by not getting vaccinated (PSE1, PSE2). Do you get the message? - Should I mention about side effects?
